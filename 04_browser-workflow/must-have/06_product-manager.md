## 🎯 Common Product Management Tasks

### Task 1: Write User Stories

**Optimized Prompt Pattern:**
```
Generate user stories for:
[describe feature]

Context:
- User persona: [type of user]
- Goal: [what they want to achieve]
- Problem: [current pain point]

Format:
As a [persona]
I want [capability]
So that [benefit]

Include acceptance criteria and edge cases
```

**Token savings:** ~65% (product approach pre-defined in Custom Instructions)

---

### Task 2: Prioritization Analysis

**Optimized Prompt Pattern:**
```
Help prioritize these features:
[list 3-5 feature ideas]

Prioritization framework: [RICE/MoSCoW/Value vs Effort]

For each feature, analyze:
- User value (0-10)
- Implementation effort (S/M/L/XL)
- Strategic alignment
- Risks and dependencies

Recommend: Build now / Build later / Don't build
```

**Why this works:**
- Clear decision framework
- Product context from Custom Instructions
- Actionable recommendations

---

### Task 3: Product Metrics

**Optimized Prompt Pattern:**
```
Define success metrics for:
[describe feature or initiative]

Product type: [type]
Goal: [business objective]

Suggest:
- North star metric
- Supporting metrics
- Leading indicators
- How to measure (tools/methods)
```

**Token efficiency:**
- Your product context already in Custom Instructions
- Specific metric definitions
- Measurement approach

---

### Task 4: Competitive Analysis

**Optimized Prompt Pattern:**
```
Analyze competitive landscape for:
[product/feature area]

Competitors: [list if known, or ask Claude to suggest]

Compare:
- Features and capabilities
- Pricing/positioning
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Market gaps and opportunities
```

**Why this works:**
- Strategic thinking from Custom Instructions
- Clear analysis framework
- Actionable insights

---

### Task 5: Stakeholder Communication

**Optimized Prompt Pattern:**
```
Draft [email/update/presentation] for:

Audience: [executives/engineering/customers]
Topic: [what to communicate]
Goal: [inform/persuade/align]

Key points:
- [point 1]
- [point 2]

Tone: [formal/casual/technical]
```

**Token savings:** ~70% (communication style pre-loaded)

## 💡 Workflow Optimization Tips

### 1. Create Projects by Product/Initiative
- Project: [ProductName] - Product Management
- Upload: PRDs, user research, analytics dashboards

Each step builds on previous context.
