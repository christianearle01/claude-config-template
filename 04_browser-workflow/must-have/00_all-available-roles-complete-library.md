Use the [Custom Role Generator](01_custom-role.md) to create hybrid Custom Instructions:
- Combine elements from multiple role templates
- Prioritize your primary responsibilities
- Keep it focused (under 1500 chars per section)

Example: Full-Stack Developer might combine:

- Software Engineer (backend APIs, testing)
- DevOps Engineer (deployment, monitoring)
