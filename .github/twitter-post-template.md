🎉 claude-config-template v4.21.0 Released - Seeking Validation Partners

After completing 100% research (analyzing 9 community patterns including Cursor, Fabric, Beads, and AGENTS.md), I've released v4.21.0 with comprehensive Claude Code configuration templates.

📊 The Claim: 50-95% token savings through intelligent context management

🔍 The Reality Check: These are *projected* savings based on token math. I need real-world data.

🙏 How You Can Help:

I'm looking for 5-10 early adopters to:
1. Test the 5-minute success path
2. Measure actual token savings
3. Share honest feedback

What's In It For You:
• 1-on-1 setup support from the author (me!)
• Priority bug fixes for your use case
• Your feedback shapes the v5.0 roadmap
• Recognition in project credits

🧠 Why This Matters:

Right now, this is a 1-user project (me) with theoretical projections. Your data transforms:
• "Projected 50-95% savings" → "Measured X% savings from Y users"
• Theory → Evidence
• Projections → Metrics

External validation from 9 patterns shows the *approach* is sound. Now we need *user data* to prove the *results* are real.

✅ Industry Alignment:
• AGENTS.md (20,000+ GitHub projects)
• Cursor (50%+ Fortune 500 companies)
• Fabric (233+ community patterns)
• Beads (60,000+ projects)

📚 What's Included:
• 22,400+ lines of documentation
• 269 features documented
• 20 skills in catalog
• 5 persona-based learning paths

🚀 Get Started:

5-Minute Test: https://github.com/christianearle01/claude-config-template/blob/main/docs/00-start-here/03_5-minute-success.md

## Reddit Post (r/ClaudeAI)

### Title
```
[v4.21.0] Seeking 5-10 Validators: Claude Code Config Template (Projected 50-95% Token Savings)
```

### Body
```
Hey r/ClaudeAI! 👋

I just released v4.21.0 of claude-config-template after completing 100% research on community patterns (Cursor, Fabric, Beads, AGENTS.md - 9 patterns total).

**TL;DR:** Configuration templates for Claude Code with *projected* 50-95% token savings. Need real users to validate these claims.

## What I'm Looking For

5-10 early adopters to:
1. Test the [5-minute success path](https://github.com/christianearle01/claude-config-template/blob/main/docs/00-start-here/03_5-minute-success.md)
2. Measure actual token savings vs current workflow
3. Share honest feedback on what worked / what didn't

## What You Get

- 1-on-1 setup support from me (the author)
- Priority bug fixes for your specific use case
- Your feedback shapes v5.0 roadmap
- Recognition in project credits (if you want)

## Why I'm Asking

Right now, all metrics are **projected** based on token math and theoretical analysis. I'm one user (me), and I need real-world data to transform:
- "Projected 50-95% savings" → "Measured X% savings from Y users"
- "Estimated 5-min setup" → "Actual Y-min setup (tested with Z users)"

## External Validation

The *approach* is validated by 9 community patterns:
- ✅ AGENTS.md (20,000+ GitHub projects)
- ✅ Cursor (50%+ Fortune 500 companies)
- ✅ Fabric (233+ community patterns)
- ✅ Beads (60,000+ projects)

Industry convergence shows we're on the right track. Now need *user data* to prove *results*.

## What's Included

- 22,400+ lines of documentation
- 269 features (skills, agents, commands, templates)
- 5 persona-based learning paths (5 min to 90 min)
- Interactive wizards with validation
- Visual guides to reduce cognitive load

## How to Participate

1. Try the 5-minute path: [docs/00-start-here/03_5-minute-success.md](https://github.com/christianearle01/claude-config-template/blob/main/docs/00-start-here/03_5-minute-success.md)
2. Track setup time and token usage
3. Share results: [Validation Feedback](https://github.com/christianearle01/claude-config-template/issues/new?template=validation-feedback.md)

## Honesty Policy

Following my own Documentation Honesty Policy (from CLAUDE.md):
- ❌ I will NOT claim "50+ users validate this!"
- ✅ I WILL be transparent: "1 user, seeking validation"
- ✅ I WILL update metrics as real data comes in

Integrity > marketing.
