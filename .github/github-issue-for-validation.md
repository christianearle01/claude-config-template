## Title: 🙏 Seeking 5-10 Validators for v4.21.0 - Help Prove This Works!

## Body:

**v4.21.0 "External Perspectives - Complete Edition" just released!** 🎉

After 100% research completion (9 community patterns analyzed), we've validated our approach aligns with industry standards (AGENTS.md, Fabric, Cursor, Beads - 20K-60K+ projects using similar patterns).

**Now we need YOUR help to prove the projected 50-95% token savings are real.**

### What We Need

**5-10 early adopters to:**
1. Test the [5-Minute Success Guide](https://github.com/christianearle01/claude-config-template/blob/main/docs/00-start-here/03_5-minute-success.md)
2. Measure actual token savings vs. your current workflow
3. Share feedback on what worked / what was confusing

### What You Get

- ✅ **1-on-1 setup support** from the author (me!)
- ✅ **Priority bug fixes** for your specific use case
- ✅ **Your feedback shapes v5.0** roadmap
- ✅ **Recognition in project credits** (if you want)

### How to Participate

1. Try the 5-minute path: [docs/00-start-here/03_5-minute-success.md](https://github.com/christianearle01/claude-config-template/blob/main/docs/00-start-here/03_5-minute-success.md)
2. Track your setup time and token usage (instructions in guide)
3. Share results using the [Validation Feedback template](https://github.com/christianearle01/claude-config-template/issues/new?template=validation-feedback.md)

### Why This Matters

Right now, all metrics are **projected** (theoretical estimates based on token math). Your real-world data helps:
- Transform "projected 50-95% savings" → "measured X% savings from Y users"
- Validate which features actually work vs. sound good in theory
- Identify friction points new users hit
- Build case studies for future adopters

### Project Status

- **Version:** 4.21.0 (just released 2025-12-20)
- **Real users:** 1 (the author - me!)
- **Documentation:** 22,400+ lines, 269 features
- **External validation:** Aligned with AGENTS.md (20K+ projects), Cursor (50%+ Fortune 500), Fabric (233+ patterns), Beads (60K+ projects)

**We're confident the approach works - now we need data to prove it!**
