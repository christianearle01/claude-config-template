## Quick Decision Tree

```
Are you NEW to Claude Code?
├─ YES → Start with Foundation Skills (5 skills, 10 min setup)
└─ NO → Do you have a specific workflow?
    ├─ Domain Memory (features.json) → Add project-analyzer
    ├─ Test-Driven Development → Add testing-workflow + test-generator
    ├─ API Development → Add api-debugging + security-scanner
    ├─ Team Project → Add standards-enforcer + mode-selector
    └─ Want Meta-Skills → Strategic Skills (workflow-analyzer, personalization-engine)
```
