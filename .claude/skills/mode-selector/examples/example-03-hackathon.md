# Example 3: Hackathon Project (Vibe Coding)

## User Message

"I'm doing a 48-hour hackathon this weekend. Theme is 'AI for education.' I have a teammate (designer). No idea what to build yet, but we want to win a prize."

## Skill Activation

**Trigger detected:** Timeline pressure ("48-hour hackathon") + Quality uncertainty (implied: what level of polish needed?)

**Context signals:**
- Temporary (demo only, throwaway after)
- Low risk (competition, no real users)
- Extremely tight timeline (48 hours)

**Lightweight analysis:**
- Temporary? **Yes** → Vibe Coding
- High risk? **No** → Vibe Coding
- Tight timeline? **Yes** (extreme!) → Vibe Coding

**Score:** 3/3 signals point to Vibe Coding

## Skill Response

```
🎯 I noticed you're doing a hackathon with an extreme timeline.
Let me help you choose the right mode for this task.

Based on what you've described, I recommend: **Strong Vibe Coding (Hackathon Mode)**

Hackathons reward working demos, not production code. Your goal is to build something impressive in 48 hours, not maintainable software. Use templates, fake data, hardcode everything, copy-paste liberally. Focus on demo appeal: visual impact + working flow + compelling story. Skip tests, docs, error handling completely. Code quality doesn't matter - judges see 2 minutes of demo, not your codebase.

## Expected User Actions

**Vibe Coding (Hackathon) approach:**

**Hour 0-4: Ideation**
- Brainstorm 5-10 education + AI ideas
- Pick one with high demo appeal (visual, impactful)
- Sketch UI mockup (designer leads)

**Hour 4-12: Rapid prototyping**
- Use template (Bootstrap/Tailwind for speed)
- Integrate AI API (OpenAI, no custom models)
- Get something on screen (any output is progress)

**Hour 12-36: Feature building**
- Add 3-5 "wow" features (focus on judges' reaction)
- Fake anything that's slow (mock AI responses if API is slow)
- Ignore error handling (demo won't have errors)

**Hour 36-44: Polish for demo**
- Designer: Make it look professional
- Practice demo flow (rehearse 2-minute pitch)
- Fix only demo-breaking bugs

**Hour 44-48: Prep + rest**
- Write elevator pitch (30 seconds)
- Sleep (look alert for judging)

**What to skip entirely:**
- Tests (no time)
- Documentation (won't exist after weekend)
- Code review (trust each other)
- Refactoring (code quality irrelevant)
- Authentication (it's a demo)

## Why This Recommendation Is Correct

**Indicators of success:**
- ✅ Working demo in 48 hours (met extreme deadline)
- ✅ Impressive presentation (judges engaged)
- ✅ Team had fun (no perfectionism stress)

**If user had chosen Vibe Engineering instead:**
- ❌ 48 hours spent architecting, no demo built
- ❌ Perfect code that doesn't work (judges see nothing)
- ❌ Missed submission deadline (trying to get tests to pass)

**Lesson:** Hackathons are the ultimate Vibe Coding context. Working > perfect.

## Hackathon-Specific Tips

**Demo appeal optimization:**
- Visual > functional (pretty UI beats boring command line)
- Story > technology (compelling narrative beats technical depth)
- Working flow > feature completeness (one complete flow > five half-done features)

**Technology choices:**
- Use what you know (learning new tech wastes time)
- Pre-made components (don't build from scratch)
- No-code tools are acceptable (Airtable, Zapier, etc.)

**Time management:**
- Cut scope ruthlessly (one good feature > ten mediocre ones)
- Avoid rabbit holes (if stuck for 30 min, move on)
- Sleep strategy (power nap at hour 32, alert for judging)
