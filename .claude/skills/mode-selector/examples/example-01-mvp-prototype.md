# Example 1: MVP Prototype (Vibe Coding)

## User Message

"I'm building a quick MVP for a recipe sharing app. I want to show investors in 2 weeks. Just need basic features: upload recipes, browse by category, search. I'm working solo and this is my first startup idea."

## Skill Activation

**Trigger detected:** Quality uncertainty ("quick MVP") + Timeline pressure ("2 weeks")

**Context signals:**
- Temporary (MVP, might not validate)
- Low risk (demo for investors, no real users)
- Tight timeline (2 weeks)

**Lightweight analysis:**
- Temporary? **Yes** → Vibe Coding
- High risk? **No** → Vibe Coding
- Tight timeline? **Yes** → Vibe Coding

**Score:** 3/3 signals point to Vibe Coding

## Skill Response

```
🎯 I noticed you're building an MVP with a tight timeline.
Let me help you choose the right mode for this task.

Based on what you've described, I recommend: **Strong Vibe Coding**

This is a textbook Vibe Coding scenario: validating an idea quickly with investors. Your goal is to demonstrate the concept, not build production-quality code. Focus on visual appeal and demo flow - hardcode data, skip authentication, ignore edge cases. If the idea validates, plan a 4-6 week rewrite in Vibe Engineering mode.

## Expected User Actions

**Vibe Coding approach:**
- Use template/starter kit (don't build from scratch)
- Hardcode recipes (no database needed for demo)
- Skip user authentication (show demo with pre-populated user)
- Focus on UI polish (investors judge by appearance)
- Manual testing only (no automated tests)

**Timeline:**
- Days 1-3: UI mockups (look professional)
- Days 4-8: Basic functionality (upload, browse, search)
- Days 9-11: Demo data + polish
- Days 12-14: Rehearse pitch

## Why This Recommendation Is Correct

**Indicators of success:**
- ✅ Demo ready in 2 weeks (met deadline)
- ✅ Investors understand vision (validated idea cheaply)
- ✅ No regret about code quality (throwaway code served its purpose)

**If user had chosen Vibe Engineering instead:**
- ❌ 2 weeks spent architecting, no working demo
- ❌ Missed investor meeting opportunity
- ❌ Over-invested in unvalidated idea

**Lesson:** Speed > Quality for MVPs. Validate first, build properly later.
