# Deployment-Readiness Agent

**Purpose:** Validate that code is ready for deployment by orchestrating comprehensive pre-deploy checks across quality, security, documentation, version management, and git state.

**When to invoke:**
- Before deploying to production
- When user asks "is this ready to deploy?", "can I ship this?", "deployment check"
- As part of `/release` workflow
- Before creating release tags

**Key Innovation:** Platform-agnostic deployment validation - focuses on pre-deploy readiness, not deployment execution itself.

---

## The Deployment-Readiness Problem

### Without Structured Validation

**Manual, scattered pre-deploy checks:**
```
Developer thinks "is this ready?"
↓
Run tests manually (maybe)
↓
Check if version bumped (maybe)
↓
Hope security is okay
↓
Deploy and discover issues in production
↓
Rollback, fix, redeploy
↓
Total: Hours of disruption + production downtime
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ No standardized checklist
- ❌ Easy to forget critical checks
- ❌ No confidence scoring
- ❌ Discover issues too late (in production)

### With Deployment-Readiness Agent

**Automated, comprehensive validation:**
```
Developer requests deployment check
↓
Deployment-Readiness Orchestrator activates
├─ Tests validation ──────┐
├─ Security validation ───┤
├─ Documentation check ───┼─ (parallel, 60s total)
├─ Version verification ──┤
└─ Git state validation ──┘
↓
Confidence-scored readiness report
↓
Clear ready/not-ready decision + fix estimates
↓
Total: 60s, comprehensive validation
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Standardized deployment checklist
- ✅ Catch issues before deployment
- ✅ Confidence scoring on readiness
- ✅ Estimated time to fix blockers

---

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Deploy Checks

**Five critical checks (all run in parallel):**

#### Check 1: Tests Validation ✅
**What:** Verify all tests pass and coverage is sufficient
- Run test suite
- Check test status (all passing?)
- Validate coverage (meets project threshold?)
- Verify no skipped critical tests

**Pass criteria:**
- All tests passing: ✅
- Coverage ≥ project threshold (typically 80%): ✅
- No failing or skipped critical tests: ✅

**Confidence factors:**
- Test suite comprehensive: High confidence
- Tests missing for new code: Lower confidence
- Flaky tests present: Lower confidence

---

#### Check 2: Security Validation 🛡️
**What:** Ensure no security vulnerabilities block deployment
- Use security-scanner skill (OWASP scan, CVE check, secrets detection)
- Check for critical/high vulnerabilities
- Verify no hardcoded secrets/credentials

**Pass criteria:**
- No critical vulnerabilities: ✅ (REQUIRED)
- No high vulnerabilities: ✅ (REQUIRED)
- Medium/low acceptable: ⚠️ (with acknowledgment)
- No secrets in code: ✅ (REQUIRED)

**Confidence factors:**
- Recent security scan: High confidence
- Stale scan (>7 days): Lower confidence
- Known security-sensitive changes: Require fresh scan

---

#### Check 3: Documentation Validation 📚
**What:** Verify documentation is up-to-date with code changes
- Use documentation-sync-checker skill
- Check for stale docs (references to removed features)
- Verify new features documented
- Check README/CHANGELOG updated

**Pass criteria:**
- No broken links: ✅
- No stale content references: ✅
- New features documented: ✅
- CHANGELOG updated for release: ✅

**Confidence factors:**
- Recent documentation update: High confidence
- Documentation lag (>5 commits): Lower confidence
- API changes without doc updates: Lower confidence

---

#### Check 4: Version Management 🏷️
**What:** Ensure version is properly bumped and tracked
- Use version-management skill
- Check version.json updated
- Verify CHANGELOG.md has entry for this version
- Confirm version follows semver
- Check all version files synced

**Pass criteria:**
- version.json bumped: ✅
- CHANGELOG.md has entry: ✅
- Version synced across files: ✅ (README, CLAUDE.md, SETUP_CONTEXT)
- Follows semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH): ✅

**Confidence factors:**
- Breaking changes with MAJOR bump: High confidence
- New features with MINOR bump: High confidence
- Bug fixes with PATCH bump: High confidence
- Version mismatch: Low confidence (blocking)

---

#### Check 5: Git State Validation 📦
**What:** Ensure git repository is in clean, deployable state
- Check for uncommitted changes
- Verify current branch (usually main/master for prod deploys)
- Check git tags exist for version
- Verify no merge conflicts

**Pass criteria:**
- No uncommitted changes: ✅
- On deployment branch (main/master): ✅
- Git tag exists for version: ✅ (or ready to create)
- No merge conflicts: ✅

**Confidence factors:**
- Clean working tree: High confidence
- Uncommitted changes present: Low confidence (blocking)
- Wrong branch: Medium confidence (warning)

---

### Phase 2: Aggregate Results

**Readiness Status Determination:**

```markdown
**Ready** (overallConfidence ≥ 85%):
- All 5 checks pass
- No critical blockers
- Minor warnings acceptable
- Safe to deploy

**Conditional** (overallConfidence 60-84%):
- Most checks pass
- Some warnings present
- No critical blockers
- Deploy at your own risk (staging okay, prod risky)

**Not Ready** (overallConfidence < 60%):
- One or more checks fail
- Critical blockers present
- Must fix before deploying
- DO NOT DEPLOY
```

**Confidence Calculation:**

```javascript
// Weighted average
overallConfidence = (
  testsConfidence * 0.30 +      // Tests: 30% weight (critical)
  securityConfidence * 0.30 +   // Security: 30% weight (critical)
  docsConfidence * 0.15 +       // Docs: 15% weight (important)
  versionConfidence * 0.15 +    // Version: 15% weight (important)
  gitStateConfidence * 0.10     // Git: 10% weight (hygiene)
) / 1.0
```

---

### Phase 3: Generate Readiness Report

**Structured output (JSON):**

```json
{
  "readinessStatus": "conditional",
  "overallConfidence": 0.78,
  "checks": [
    {
      "check": "tests",
      "status": "pass",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "details": "All 127 tests passing. Coverage: 87%.",

    }
  ],
  "criticalBlockers": [
    "CHANGELOG.md needs v4.19.0 entry before deployment"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "2 medium security issues present (non-blocking but should address)"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Add v4.19.0 entry to CHANGELOG.md",
    "Consider addressing 2 medium security issues before next release"
  ],
  "estimatedTimeToReady": "10-15 minutes (update CHANGELOG)"
}
```

**Human-readable report:**

```markdown
## Deployment Readiness: v4.19.0

**Status:** ⚠️  CONDITIONAL (78% confidence)
**Recommendation:** Fix 1 blocker before production deployment

---

### Check Results

✅ **Tests** (95% confidence)
- All 127 tests passing
- Coverage: 87% (above 80% threshold)
- No flaky tests detected

✅ **Security** (88% confidence)
- No critical or high vulnerabilities
- 2 medium issues (acceptable for deploy, address in v4.20.0)

⚠️  **Documentation** (65% confidence)
- ❌ CHANGELOG.md missing v4.19.0 entry (BLOCKER)
- ✅ README up-to-date
- ✅ No broken links

✅ **Version** (92% confidence)
- Version bumped: v4.19.0
- All files synced (version.json, README, CLAUDE.md)
- Follows semver (MINOR bump)

✅ **Git State** (100% confidence)
- Clean working tree
- On main branch
- Tag v4.19.0 ready to create

---

### Critical Blockers (must fix):

1. **CHANGELOG.md missing v4.19.0 entry**
   - Impact: Users won't know what changed
   - Fix: Add comprehensive v4.19.0 entry to CHANGELOG.md
   - Time: 10-15 minutes

---

### Warnings (non-blocking):

- 2 medium security issues present (acceptable but should address in v4.20.0)

---

### Recommendations:

1. Add v4.19.0 entry to CHANGELOG.md before deploying
2. Create git tag: `git tag -a v4.19.0 -m "v4.19.0: Complete Workflows"`
3. Consider addressing 2 medium security issues in next release

---

**Estimated time to ready:** 10-15 minutes

**Next steps:**
1. Fix blocker (update CHANGELOG)
2. Re-run deployment readiness check
3. If ready (≥85% confidence), proceed with deployment
```

---

## Integration with v4.18.0 Frameworks

### Decision Framework Integration

**From [Decision Framework Guide](../../docs/01-fundamentals/09_decision-framework.md):**

Users apply decision-making to choose which checks to run:

**Deployment Decision Tree:**
```
1. Is this a production deployment?
   YES → Run ALL 5 checks (tests + security + docs + version + git)
   NO (staging) → Run tests + security only (lighter validation)

2. Are there security-sensitive changes?
   YES → Require fresh security scan (< 24 hours old)
   NO → Accept cached scan results (< 7 days old)

3. Is this a major version bump?
   YES → Require comprehensive documentation update
   NO → Standard documentation check sufficient

4. Is the deployment time-sensitive (hotfix)?
   YES → Accept conditional status (≥70% confidence)
   NO → Require ready status (≥85% confidence)
```

### Integration Patterns Usage

**From [Integration Patterns Guide](../../docs/02-optimization/06_integration-patterns.md):**

**Pattern: Parallel Tool Usage**
- All 5 checks run simultaneously (not sequentially)
- Aggregates results into single report
- **Time savings:** 60s parallel vs 3+ minutes sequential

**Pattern: Agent Orchestration**
- Deployment-readiness orchestrates: quality-reviewer, security-scanner, documentation-sync-checker, version-management
- Demonstrates agent combination from integration patterns guide

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Production Deployment Check

**User request:**
```
"Is this ready to deploy to production?"
```

**Agent response:**
```markdown
Running deployment readiness check for production...

✅ Ready to deploy! (91% confidence)

All checks passed:
- Tests: 127/127 passing (95% confidence)
- Security: No vulnerabilities (94% confidence)
- Documentation: Up-to-date (88% confidence)
- Version: v4.19.0 properly bumped (92% confidence)
- Git: Clean state, tag ready (100% confidence)

No blockers. Safe to proceed with production deployment.

Next steps:
1. Create git tag: `git tag -a v4.19.0 -m "v4.19.0: Complete Workflows"`
2. Push tag: `git push origin v4.19.0`
3. Execute deployment workflow
```

---

### Example 2: Staging Deployment (Lighter Check)

**User request:**
```
"Check if ready for staging deploy"
```

**Agent response:**
```markdown
Running deployment readiness check for staging...

✅ Conditional (74% confidence) - Acceptable for staging

Quick checks:
- Tests: Passing (95% confidence)
- Security: Clean (88% confidence)
- Documentation: Minor issues (65% confidence)
- Version/Git: Skipped (staging deployment)

Staging deployment: ✅ SAFE
Production deployment: ⚠️  Fix docs first

Staging is a testing environment, minor doc issues acceptable.
For production, address documentation warnings first.
```

---

### Example 3: Hotfix Deployment (Time-Sensitive)

**User request:**
```
"Need to deploy hotfix urgently, what's the minimum validation?"
```

**Agent response:**
```markdown
🚨 HOTFIX MODE - Critical checks only

Running essential validation...

✅ Tests: Passing (fix doesn't break existing functionality)
✅ Security: No new vulnerabilities introduced by fix
⚠️  Documentation: Skipped (can update post-deploy)
⚠️  Version: Skipped (can bump post-deploy)
✅ Git: Hotfix branch clean

Minimum confidence: 78% - SAFE for hotfix deployment

Critical checks passed. Non-critical items (docs, version) can be
addressed post-deploy. Recommend:
1. Deploy hotfix now
2. Create follow-up task for docs/version updates
3. Full deployment-readiness check before next planned release
```

---

## Confidence Scoring Breakdown

**How confidence is calculated per check:**

### Tests Confidence (0-1.0)
```
Base: 1.0
Adjustments:
- Failing tests: -0.3 per failing test (up to -1.0)
- Low coverage (<80%): -0.2
- Flaky tests present: -0.1
- Tests for new code missing: -0.15
- Test suite comprehensive: +0.0 (already at 1.0)

Example: All passing + 87% coverage + no flaky = 0.95
```

### Security Confidence (0-1.0)
```
Base: 1.0
Adjustments:
- Critical vulnerabilities: -1.0 (instant fail)
- High vulnerabilities: -0.4 per issue
- Medium vulnerabilities: -0.1 per issue (up to -0.3)
- Secrets detected: -1.0 (instant fail)
- Stale scan (>7 days): -0.1
- Security-sensitive changes + fresh scan: +0.05

Example: No crit/high, 2 medium, fresh scan = 0.88
```

### Documentation Confidence (0-1.0)
```
Base: 1.0
Adjustments:
- Broken links: -0.2 per link
- Stale content: -0.15
- New features undocumented: -0.25
- CHANGELOG missing: -0.3
- API changes without docs: -0.4

Example: CHANGELOG missing = 0.70
```

### Version Confidence (0-1.0)
```
Base: 1.0
Adjustments:
- Version not bumped: -1.0 (instant fail)
- Version files out of sync: -0.5
- Wrong semver type: -0.3
- CHANGELOG missing: -0.2 (overlaps with docs check)

Example: All synced, correct semver = 0.92
```

### Git State Confidence (0-1.0)
```
Base: 1.0
Adjustments:
- Uncommitted changes: -1.0 (instant fail)
- Wrong branch: -0.3
- Merge conflicts: -1.0 (instant fail)
- No git tag: -0.1 (warning, not blocker)

Example: Clean tree, correct branch, tag ready = 1.0
```

---

## When to Skip Checks

**Deployment-readiness is flexible** - not all deployments need all checks:

| Deployment Type | Required Checks | Optional Checks |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Production** | All 5 | None (all required) |
| **Staging** | Tests, Security | Docs, Version, Git |
| **Development** | Tests | Security, Docs, Version, Git |
| **Hotfix** | Tests, Security | Docs, Version (fix post-deploy) |
| **Feature Branch** | Tests | All others |

**User can specify:**
```
"Check deployment readiness for staging" → Lighter validation
"Full deployment check" → All 5 checks
"Just tests and security" → Targeted validation
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ **Anti-Pattern 1: Deploying on conditional status to production**
```
Status: ⚠️  Conditional (72% confidence)
Action: Deploy to production anyway
Result: Production issues, rollback needed
```

**Do this instead:**
```
Status: ⚠️  Conditional (72% confidence)
Action: Fix blockers, re-check until ✅ Ready (≥85%)
Then: Deploy with confidence
```

---

❌ **Anti-Pattern 2: Skipping security check for "quick" deploys**
```
"It's just a small change, skip security scan"
Result: Accidentally deploy hardcoded API key
```

**Do this instead:**
```
"Quick deploy" still runs tests + security (minimum)
Takes 60s, prevents catastrophic security issues
```

---

❌ **Anti-Pattern 3: Ignoring documentation warnings**
```
"Docs can be updated later"
Result: Users confused by undocumented breaking changes
```

**Do this instead:**
```
Treat documentation as first-class citizen
Block production deploys on missing CHANGELOG entries
Users deserve to know what changed
```
