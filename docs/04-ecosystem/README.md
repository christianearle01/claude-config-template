## Why Ecosystem Matters

**The power of community:**
- Third-party MCPs extend Claude's capabilities
- Plugins bundle reusable workflows
- Share expertise across teams
- Leverage collective knowledge

**Quote from power users:**
> "Power users strongly recommend Context7. It's real, well-maintained, and solves documentation staleness problem."

## Third-Party vs. Official

**CRITICAL distinction:**
- ✅ **Official:** Built by Anthropic, validated in docs
- ⚠️ **Third-Party:** Community-built, use at own discretion
- ✅ **Validated:** Tested by power users, stable
- ❌ **Unverified:** Not tested, may have issues

**All third-party tools clearly marked in docs.**

## Honesty Policy Reminder

**From CLAUDE.md:**
> "NEVER create misleading information. This is a NEW PROJECT by ONE developer."

**What's in this section:**
- ✅ Real third-party tools (Context7, Supabase, Playwright)
- ✅ Official plugin system (validated)

**We distinguish:**
- What's REAL and working
- What's THEORETICAL/PROJECTED
- What's OFFICIAL vs. THIRD-PARTY
