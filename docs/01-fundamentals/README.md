# 01 - Fundamentals

**Core concepts and essential tools for AI Augmented Coding**

---

## What's in This Section?

Learn the foundational skills and concepts that separate successful Claude Code projects from failures.

### 📚 Core Concepts

**[Skills Paradigm](SKILLS_PARADIGM.md)**
- The evolution: Commands → Agents → **Skills**
- How Skills protect context and enable transferable knowledge
- Real-world use cases (DB optimization, UI testing, team governance)
- When to use Skills vs. Agents
- **Quote:** "We stopped building agents and started building skills instead"

### 🔍 Essential Tools (Coming Soon)

**VERIFICATION_DEBUGGING.md** (Commit 4)
- Ctrl+O: The trust mechanism (MANDATORY)
- How to spot fake actions
- Code review workflow
- Fundamentals checklist

**KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md** (Commit 5)
- Ctrl+O as MANDATORY, not optional
- # hash for quick memory adds
- Progressive learning path
- AI Augmented vs. Vibe Coding framework

---

## Why These Are Fundamental

These concepts are the foundation of maintainable AI-assisted coding:

1. **Skills Paradigm** - Architectural evolution beyond agents
2. **Verification** - Ensures AI isn't faking actions (prevents disasters)
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Efficient workflow patterns

**Without these fundamentals, you risk:**
- Building "mystery code" you can't maintain
- AI creating fake console.log statements
- 3-4 hours to add simple features (vs. 5 minutes)
