## Priority-Based Shortcuts

### 🚨 MANDATORY (Use Always)

**Ctrl+O - Toggle Verbose Output**

**What it does:**
- Shows Claude's thinking tokens in real-time
- Displays prompts given to sub-agents
- Reveals every tool call Claude makes
- Exposes actual command outputs

**Why it's MANDATORY:**
- **Prevents fake actions** (console.log deception)
- **Builds understanding** (know what was built)
- **Catches mistakes early** (before they compound)
- **Maintains code ownership** (you understand everything)

**When to use:**
- During complex feature implementation (ALWAYS)
- When learning Claude Code (ALWAYS)
- When AI does something unfamiliar (ALWAYS)
- When debugging unexpected behavior (ALWAYS)
- When building critical functionality (ALWAYS)

**Quote from power users:**
> *"This is an essential part of this. You have to read everything."*

**Cost of NOT using:**
- 3-4 hours debugging fake actions
- Mystery code you can't maintain
- Technical debt accumulation
- Project failure (Vibe Coding → 80-day disaster)

**How to use:**
```
Step 1: Start task
Step 2: Press Ctrl+O IMMEDIATELY
Step 3: Read EVERY tool call as it happens
Step 4: Verify outputs are real (not fake console.logs)
Step 5: Understand what was built
```

### ⭐ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (Daily Use)

**# (Hash) - Quick Memory Add**

**What it does:**
- Quickly add context to CLAUDE.md
- No need to open file manually
- Claude remembers for future sessions

**When to use:**
- Important decisions made ("Use library X, not Y")
- Project conventions ("API routes go in /api/v1/")
- Common mistakes to avoid ("Don't use deprecated function Z")
- Architectural decisions ("We're using microservices pattern")

**Example workflow:**
```
You: Implement user authentication with JWT

Claude: [implements feature]

You: # Remember: We use JWT for auth, not sessions. Token expiry is 7 days.

[Claude adds to CLAUDE.md automatically]
```

**Why it's powerful:**
- Builds project knowledge incrementally
- Future Claude sessions remember decisions
- No context loss between sessions
- Creates living documentation

---

**/ (Slash) - Invoke Slash Commands**

**What it does:**
- Triggers custom commands you've defined
- Expands to full prompts from .claude/commands/
- Reusable workflows

**Examples:**
```
/review       → Review code against standards
/test         → Run project tests with proper reporting
/build        → Build project and report errors
/standards    → Show coding standards reference
```

**When to use:**
- Repeated workflows (code review, testing, building)
- Team-standardized processes
- Complex multi-step operations
- Consistent quality checks

**How to create:**
1. Add markdown file to `.claude/commands/`
2. Write prompt template
3. Use with `/command-name`

**See:** [Slash Commands Guide](../../01_global-setup/03_nice-to-have/03_slash-commands.md)

---

**@ (At) - Reference Files in Prompts**

**What it does:**
- Explicitly include files in conversation context
- Ensures Claude reads specific files
- Forces attention to particular code

**Examples:**
```
Review @src/auth/login.ts for security issues
Update @README.md with new installation steps
Refactor @components/Button.tsx following @STANDARDS.md
```

**When to use:**
- Reviewing specific files
- Ensuring Claude reads documentation
- Comparing multiple files
- Referencing standards/examples

**Pro tip:** Combine with commands
```
/review @src/api/*.ts
```

---

### 💡 USEFUL (Learn Later)

**Tab - Toggle Extended Thinking**

**What it does:**
- Enables deeper reasoning for complex problems
- Claude shows detailed thought process
- Higher token cost, better quality

**When to use:**
- Complex architectural decisions
- Debugging tricky issues
- Planning large features
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases

**Trade-off:**
- ✅ Better reasoning quality
- ❌ Higher token cost
- ❌ Slower responses

**When NOT to use:**
- Simple operations
- Well-understood tasks
- Quick iterations

---

**Shift+Tab - Change Permission Mode**

**What it does:**
- Switch between permission modes
- Options: Plan, Accept Edits, Ask

**Modes:**
- **Plan Mode:** Claude creates plan, you approve before execution
- **Accept Edits:** Claude makes changes automatically
- **Ask:** Claude asks before every action

**When to change:**
- Complex features → Plan Mode
- Trusted simple tasks → Accept Edits
- Learning/exploring → Ask Mode

**See:** [Permission Modes Guide](../../01_global-setup/01_must-have/02_permissions.md)

## The Ctrl+O Workflow (MANDATORY for Quality)

### Standard Workflow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. User: Give Claude a task         │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────┐
│ 2. Press Ctrl+O DURING execution    │
│    (Toggle verbose output ON)       │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────┐
│ 3. Read EVERY tool call in real-time│
│    - File operations                │
│    - Command executions             │
│    - Sub-agent spawns               │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────┐
│ 4. Verify actions are REAL          │
│    - Not fake console.logs          │
│    - Actual file changes            │
│    - Real command outputs           │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────┐
│ 5. Understand what was built        │
│    - Know architecture              │
│    - Understand patterns            │
│    - Own the code completely        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What You See with Ctrl+O

**Example output:**
```
<thinking>
User wants to implement authentication. I'll need to:
1. Create JWT utility functions
2. Add middleware for route protection
3. Update login endpoint
4. Add token refresh logic
</thinking>

<tool_call name="Write">
  <file_path>/src/utils/jwt.ts</file_path>
  <content>
  import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

  export function generateToken(userId: string) {
    return jwt.sign({ userId }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {
      expiresIn: '7d'
    });
  }
  </content>
</tool_call>

<tool_output>
  File created successfully
</tool_output>
```

**What to verify:**
- ✅ Thinking makes sense (logical approach)
- ✅ Tool call is correct (right file path)
- ✅ Content looks good (no hardcoded secrets)
- ✅ Output confirms success (actually created)

**Red flags:**
- ❌ console.log with hardcoded data
- ❌ "Imagine..." or "Pretend..." in thinking
- ❌ No actual tool calls (just text)
- ❌ Success message without operation

## AI Augmented vs. Vibe Coding Framework

### The Fundamental Difference

| Aspect | Vibe Coding ❌ | AI Augmented ✅ |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Reading output** | Skip, hope for best | Use Ctrl+O, read everything |
| **Understanding** | "Mystery code" | Know every building block |
| **Tool usage** | Never press Ctrl+O | Ctrl+O on complex tasks |
| **Update speed** | 3-4 hours per feature | 5 minutes per feature |
| **Maintainability** | Unmaintainable mess | Clean, documented |
| **Real example** | 80 days, 12K line file | 15 hours, fully understood |
| **Knowledge** | Lost after build | Retained and grows |
| **Debugging** | 3-4 hours for simple issues | Minutes to identify root cause |

### Real-World Comparison

**Vibe Coding Project (SEO Grow):**
- Timeline: 80 days to build
- Result: 12,000-line file (10,000 lines unused)
- Update cost: 3-4 hours to add simple feature
- Status: "Lead developer laughed" at codebase
- Symptom: Fake console.logs pretending to work

**AI Augmented Project (Postforge):**
- Timeline: 15 hours to build
- Result: Clean, documented, maintainable
- Update cost: 5 minutes to add simple feature
- Status: "Just as complete" as 80-day project
- Verification: Ctrl+O used throughout

**Quote:**
> *"I took 15 hours to build Postforge (AI Augmented). SEO Grow took 80 days (Vibe Coding). Postforge is just as complete and infinitely easier to update."*

### The Choice

**Vibe Coding feels:**
- ✅ Fast initially ("I built so much!")
- ✅ Effortless (just hit enter)
- ❌ Mysterious (don't understand code)
- ❌ Slow later (3-4 hours to update)
- ❌ Fragile (afraid to change things)

**AI Augmented feels:**
- ⚠️ Slightly slower initially (read outputs)
- ⚠️ Requires attention (understand everything)
- ✅ Confident (know the codebase)
- ✅ Fast later (5-minute updates)
- ✅ Robust (easy to modify)

**The metric that matters:**
> "How fast can you UPDATE your code later?" (not "How fast can you build initially?")
