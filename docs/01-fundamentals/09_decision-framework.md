## Why Decision Frameworks Matter

### The Problem: Integration Paralysis

After learning individual tools (agents, commands, skills, MCPs), users face a new challenge:
- "I know what each tool does, but which one should I use NOW?"
- "Should I use an agent or just read the file directly?"
- "When is sequential-thinking worth the extra tokens?"

**This is integration paralysis** - having powerful tools but not knowing which to choose.

### The Solution: Decision Frameworks

A decision framework is a **structured approach to tool selection** that:
1. Reduces cognitive load (follow the framework, not gut feeling)
2. Builds expertise faster (learn the patterns, not trial-and-error)
3. Optimizes outcomes (right tool = better results, fewer tokens)

**This guide teaches you the decision-making process, not just the tools.**

## Tool Selection Matrix

Quick reference: Match your task type to the recommended tool.

| Task Type | Recommended Tool | Why | Token Cost |
|-----------|------------------|-----|------------|
| **Read known file** | Read tool | Direct, fast, minimal overhead | Low (100-500) |
| **Find files by pattern** | Glob tool | Optimized for pattern matching | Low (50-200) |
| **Search code for keyword** | Grep tool | Fast text search | Low (100-300) |
| **Explore unknown codebase** | Explore agent | Systematic discovery | Medium (1K-3K) |
| **Plan implementation** | Plan agent | Architecture thinking | Medium (2K-5K) |
| **Complex decision** | Adversarial-validator agent | Multi-perspective analysis | High (3K-8K) |
| **Optimize prompt** | Prompt-polisher agent | Structured optimization | Medium (500-2K) |
| **Choose workflow mode** | Mode-selector agent | 6-dimension scoring | Medium (1K-2K) |
| **Repeated query** | Skill (auto-invoked) | Context-aware answers | Low (250-600) |
| **Workflow shortcut** | Slash command | Pre-configured sequence | Low (varies) |
| **Multi-step reasoning** | Sequential-thinking MCP | Structured analysis | Medium (1K-3K) |

**Key principle:** Start with the simplest tool that solves the problem. Escalate only when needed.

## Complexity Flowchart

### When to Escalate from Simple to Complex Tools

```
START: What's the task?

├─ KNOWN file location?
│  YES → Use Read tool directly ✓
│  NO → Continue to exploration
│
├─ Simple PATTERN search?
│  YES → Use Glob (files) or Grep (content) ✓
│  NO → Continue to exploration
│
├─ Need to UNDERSTAND codebase structure?
│  YES → Use Explore agent ✓
│  NO → Continue to decision complexity
│
├─ Multiple VALID approaches?
│  YES → Use Adversarial-validator agent ✓
│  NO → Continue to implementation
│
├─ Need to PLAN multi-file changes?
│  YES → Use Plan agent ✓
│  NO → Use direct tools (Read + Edit)
│
└─ IMPLEMENT changes
   → Use appropriate tools (Edit, Write, Bash)
```

**Escalation triggers:**
1. **Uncertainty** - Don't know where to start → Explore agent
2. **Complexity** - Multiple files, unclear scope → Plan agent
3. **High stakes** - Architecture decisions → Adversarial-validator
4. **Optimization** - Want better approach → Mode-selector + Prompt-polisher

## Agents vs Commands vs Skills

### Understanding the Three Tool Types

| Feature | Agents | Commands | Skills |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Invocation** | `@agent-name` | `/command` | Automatic |
| **Purpose** | Complex tasks | Workflow shortcuts | Knowledge queries |
| **Scope** | READ+WRITE | READ+WRITE | READ-only |
| **Token cost** | High (1K-8K) | Varies | Low (250-600) |
| **Best for** | Multi-step tasks | Repeated operations | Frequent questions |
| **Examples** | Plan, Explore | /build, /test, /review | Projects-registry |

### When to Use Each

**Use Agents when:**
- Task requires multi-step reasoning
- Need structured output or analysis
- Want confidence scores and breakdowns
- Exploring multiple approaches
- **Example:** "I need to plan a refactoring strategy" → Plan agent

**Use Commands when:**
- Running project-specific workflows
- Repeated operations (build, test, review)
- Shortcuts for common sequences
- **Example:** "Run the test suite" → /test command

**Use Skills when:**
- Asking questions about known topics
- Querying project registry or status
- Need quick answers without exploration
- **Example:** "Which projects need updates?" → Projects-registry skill auto-invokes

### Combining Tools

**Powerful patterns:**
1. **Skill → Agent:** Skill answers question, agent acts on it
   - "Show outdated projects" (skill) → Plan updates (agent)

2. **Agent → Command:** Agent plans, command executes
   - Plan refactoring (agent) → /review to validate (command)

3. **Command → Skill:** Command runs, skill provides insights
   - /test (command) → Testing-workflow skill diagnoses failures

## Model Selection Integration

### Three-Question Method (from v3.11.0)

After choosing your tool, choose your model:

```
1. Is this CREATIVE or ARCHITECTURAL work?
   YES → Use Opus
   Examples: System design, architecture decisions, complex planning

2. Does this involve WRITING CODE?
   YES → Use Sonnet
   Examples: Implementation, refactoring, bug fixes

3. Is this MECHANICAL or EXPLORATORY?
   YES → Use Haiku
   Examples: File search, simple reads, pattern matching
```

### Model Selection by Tool

**Pre-configured in agents** (`.claude/agents/*.md`):

| Agent | Recommended Model | Why |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| Adversarial-validator | **Opus** | Multi-perspective reasoning, high-stakes decisions |
| Project-planner | **Opus** | 6-perspective architecture analysis |
| Initializer | **Opus** | Feature decomposition, learning path design |
| Coder | **Sonnet** | Balanced implementation work |
| Prompt-polisher | **Sonnet** | Structured prompt optimization |
| Explore | **Haiku** | Fast codebase navigation |
| Quality-reviewer | **Haiku** | Rule-based orchestration |

**Cost impact:**
- Explore with Haiku vs Sonnet: 91% cheaper
- Adversarial-validator with Opus vs Sonnet: Worth 3x cost for better decisions
- Overall: 24% token reduction when using optimal models

## Decision Trees by Task Type

### Bug Fix Decision Tree

```
1. Do you know which FILE has the bug?
   YES → Read the file directly
   NO → Use Grep to search error message or Explore agent

2. Is the ROOT CAUSE obvious?
   YES → Fix directly with Edit
   NO → Use sequential-thinking MCP to analyze

3. Will the fix affect MULTIPLE files?
   YES → Use Plan agent to coordinate changes
   NO → Fix the single file

4. Is this a CRITICAL bug in production?
   YES → Use Testing-workflow skill + Quality-reviewer agent
   NO → Standard fix → test → commit workflow
```

**Example:**
- Known bug in `auth.ts` line 45 → Read → Edit → Done (200 tokens)
- Mystery authentication error → Grep "auth error" → Read files → sequential-thinking → Plan → Fix (3K tokens, but thorough)

---

### New Feature Decision Tree

```
1. Is the feature WELL-DEFINED with clear requirements?
   YES → Use Plan agent → Implement
   NO → Use Project-planner agent first (6 perspectives)

2. Will this require MULTIPLE sessions to complete?
   YES → Use Domain Memory pattern (Initializer + Coder agents)
   NO → Standard implementation

3. Does this involve ARCHITECTURE decisions?
   YES → Use Adversarial-validator agent (3 personas)
   NO → Proceed with Plan agent

4. Do you need QUALITY validation?
   YES → Use Quality-reviewer agent after implementation
   NO → Standard review process
```

**Example:**
- Add logout button → Plan → Implement → Done (2K tokens)
- Build user dashboard → Project-planner (Opus) → Initializer → Coder (Sonnet) → Quality-reviewer (4 sessions, 12K tokens total, but robust)

---

### Refactoring Decision Tree

```
1. Is the refactoring scope CLEAR?
   YES → Plan agent → Implement
   NO → Explore agent first to understand structure

2. Are there MULTIPLE valid approaches?
   YES → Adversarial-validator agent (compare approaches)
   NO → Proceed with chosen approach

3. Will this affect MANY files?
   YES → Create detailed plan, phase the work
   NO → Direct refactoring

4. Need to maintain BACKWARD compatibility?
   YES → Quality-reviewer agent for validation
   NO → Standard testing
```

**Example:**
- Extract 3 functions to utils → Read → Edit → Done (500 tokens)
- Refactor authentication system → Explore → Adversarial-validator (3 approaches) → Plan → Implement in phases (8K tokens, but prevents rework)

---

### Optimization Decision Tree

```
1. What are you optimizing?
   CODE PERFORMANCE → Profile first, Plan changes
   TOKEN USAGE → Mode-selector + Prompt-polisher agents
   WORKFLOW SPEED → Analyze bottlenecks, use appropriate automation

2. Do you know the OPTIMAL approach?
   YES → Implement directly
   NO → Use Adversarial-validator to compare approaches

3. Is this a ONE-TIME optimization?
   YES → Do it manually, document the pattern
   NO → Create slash command or skill for reuse

4. Need to measure IMPACT?
   YES → Before/after metrics, validate improvement
   NO → Implement and monitor
```

**Example:**
- "My prompts are too verbose" → Prompt-polisher (educational mode) → Learn patterns → Apply (1.5K tokens, learn for future)
- "Which workflow mode?" → Mode-selector agent → Get recommendation (1K tokens)

## Quick Reference

### Start Here: 3-Step Decision Process

**Step 1: Define the task**
- What am I trying to accomplish?
- What do I already know vs need to discover?

**Step 2: Choose the simplest tool**
- Known file → Read
- Unknown location → Glob or Grep
- Need exploration → Explore agent
- Complex decision → Higher-level agent

**Step 3: Escalate only if needed**
- Simple tool didn't work? → Try next level
- Multiple approaches possible? → Use decision agent
- High stakes? → Use validation agent

---

### Red Flags: When You're Using the Wrong Tool

**🚩 Over-using agents for simple tasks**
- "I need to read config.json" → Don't use Explore agent, just Read
- **Fix:** Use simplest tool first (Read), escalate only if needed

**🚩 Using sequential-thinking for trivial decisions**
- "Should I use const or let?" → Don't need deep analysis
- **Fix:** Trust your judgment on straightforward choices

**🚩 Skipping exploration phase**
- Editing files without understanding codebase structure
- **Fix:** Use Explore agent first, especially in unfamiliar code

**🚩 Not using skills for repeated questions**
- Manually checking project status every time
- **Fix:** Skills auto-invoke for common queries (e.g., projects-registry)

**🚩 Using wrong model**
- Running Explore agent with Opus (expensive, unnecessary)
- **Fix:** Match model to task complexity (Haiku for exploration)
