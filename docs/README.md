## 🧠+🎓+👨‍💻 Why This Structure?

**Psychological (🧠):**
- Clear progression reduces anxiety
- Know your level = confidence
- Fear of failure addressed first (Anti-Patterns)

**Educational (🎓):**
- Natural learning path (can't skip fundamentals)
- Builds on previous knowledge
- Progressive disclosure (don't overwhelm)

**Engineering (👨‍💻):**
- Numbered folders maintain order
- Clear module boundaries
- Easy to find files by level + topic
- Scales well (can add more levels)
