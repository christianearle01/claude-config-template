## 💡 Key Concepts

### 1. CLAUDE.md - Your Project's Memory

**What is it?**
A file that documents WHAT your project does (business purpose), so Claude doesn't waste tokens exploring files.

**What to document:**
- ✅ Business purpose: "This app helps X users do Y"
- ✅ Key features: From user perspective
- ✅ External APIs: WHY each is used (business reason)
- ✅ Coding conventions: Your team's standards

**What NOT to document:**
- ❌ Full dependency list (Claude reads package.json)
- ❌ Implementation details (Claude reads code)
- ❌ Technical stack (Claude can detect it)

**Token savings:** 95% (20K tokens → 1K tokens per session)

### 2. Model Switching - Save 92% on Costs

**The Strategy:**
1. **Sonnet for planning** - "Plan how to add OAuth authentication"
2. **Switch to Haiku** - `/model haiku`
3. **Haiku for implementation** - "Implement the plan you created"

**Cost comparison:**
- Sonnet: $3 per million tokens
- Haiku: $0.25 per million tokens
- **Savings: 92% on implementation**

**Example:**
```
You: "Plan feature X"
Claude (Sonnet): [Creates detailed plan] - Cost: $0.03

You: "/model haiku"
You: "Implement the plan"
Claude (Haiku): [Implements] - Cost: $0.0125 (vs $0.15 with Sonnet)

Savings: 92%! 💰
```

### 3. Visual Guides - Reduce Cognitive Load

We provide **5 Mermaid diagrams** to help you understand:
1. Configuration Hierarchy (where settings come from)
2. Model Selection Flowchart (which model when)
3. CLAUDE.md Anatomy (what to document)
4. Setup Roadmap (time estimates)
5. Token Cost Waterfall (visualize savings)

**View them:** Open `VISUAL_GUIDES.md`

## 🚀 Example Workflow

### Setting Up a New Project

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# 2. Run the quick setup wizard
~/claude-config-template/scripts/wizard-quick-setup.sh ~/claude-config-template

# 3. The wizard will:
#    ✓ Copy .claude/ configuration
#    ✓ Create CLAUDE.md from template
#    ✓ Open editor for you to document business purpose
#    ✓ Validate your setup
#    ✓ Test with Claude Code

# 4. Start using Claude Code
claude

# 5. Test it works
You: "What does this project do?"
Claude: [Explains your project without exploring files!]

# Success! 🎉
```

### Optimizing Costs with Model Switching

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# 1. Plan with Sonnet (default)
You: "Plan how to add user authentication with OAuth"
Claude (Sonnet): [Creates detailed implementation plan]
Cost: ~10K tokens × $3 = $0.03

# 2. Switch to Haiku for implementation
You: "/model haiku"
Claude: ✓ Switched to Haiku

# 3. Implement with Haiku
You: "Implement the plan you just created"
Claude (Haiku): [Implements the feature]
Cost: ~50K tokens × $0.25 = $0.0125

# Total cost: $0.0425 (vs $0.18 without switching)
# Savings: 76%! 💰
```

### Keeping Template Updated

```bash
# Check for updates
cd ~/claude-config-template
./scripts/claude-update.sh --check

# If update available, apply it
./scripts/claude-update.sh --apply

# Automatic backup created before update
# Can rollback anytime: ./scripts/claude-update.sh --rollback
```

## 💰 Projected Cost Savings

**📝 Note:** Examples below are theoretical projections based on Anthropic's pricing, not actual user data.

### Example Scenario: Implementing a Feature (Theoretical)

**Projected usage without template:**

```
1. Claude explores codebase: 20K tokens × $3 = $0.06
2. Asks clarifying questions: 5K tokens × $3 = $0.015
3. Implements feature: 50K tokens × $3 = $0.15
4. Debugging and refinement: 15K tokens × $3 = $0.045

Total: 90K tokens × $3 = $0.27
```

### Example With This Template (Theoretical)

**Same scenario:**

```
1. Claude reads CLAUDE.md (cached): 1K tokens × $3 = $0.003
2. Plan with Sonnet: 10K tokens × $3 = $0.03
3. Switch to Haiku for implementation: 50K × $0.25 = $0.0125
4. Debugging with Haiku: 10K tokens × $0.25 = $0.0025

Total: 71K tokens, mixed cost = $0.048

Example savings: $0.222 (82% reduction!)
```

**Projected monthly savings (10 features - example):**
- Before: $2.70
- After: $0.48
- **Example savings: $2.22/month per developer**

**Projected for team of 10 developers:**
- **Example savings: $266/year**

**Note:** Actual savings depend on your usage patterns. This template is new (1 user) - help us validate these projections!
