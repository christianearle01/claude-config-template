## Quick Reference Card

### Essential Commands

```bash
/model haiku      # Switch to cheap model (66.7% cost savings)
/model sonnet     # Switch to balanced model (default)
/model opus       # Switch to most capable model (use sparingly)
/usage            # Check your plan limits and usage
/clear            # Start fresh context (reset conversation)
/doctor           # Diagnose Claude Code installation issues
/help             # Show all available commands
```

### Model Switching Strategy (Save 66.7% on costs!)

**The Strategy:**
1. **🎯 Sonnet for Planning** - "Plan how to implement feature X"
2. **⚡ Haiku for Implementation** - After plan approved, switch: `/model haiku`
3. **🧠 Opus for Complex Problems** - Only when Sonnet struggles

**Example Workflow:**
```
You: "Plan how to add OAuth authentication"
Claude (Sonnet): [Creates detailed plan]
You: "/model haiku"
You: "Implement the plan you just created"
Claude (Haiku): [Implements at 66.7% lower cost]
```

**Cost Comparison:**
- Sonnet: $3 per million input tokens
- Haiku: $0.25 per million input tokens
- **Savings: 92%** when using Haiku for implementation!

### Token Optimization Tips

**Be Specific:**
```
❌ "Fix the bug"
✅ "Fix the NoneType error in app/user.py:127 where email is accessed without None check"
```

**Reference Files:**
```
❌ "Add validation"
✅ "Add email validation to signup() in app/auth.py, follow the pattern in app/utils.py:45"
```

**Tell What to Skip:**
```
❌ "Review the code"
✅ "Review app/auth.py for security issues. Skip: tests/, migrations/, node_modules/"
```

**Provide Context:**
```
❌ "Implement the feature"
✅ "Implement OAuth following the pattern in app/google_auth.py. Use OAUTH_CLIENT_ID from .env. Skip exploring - I'll tell you what you need."
```

### CLAUDE.md Purpose

**What to Document:**
- ✅ **Business Purpose:** "This app helps X users do Y"
- ✅ **Key Features:** From user perspective (not technical details)
- ✅ **External APIs:** WHY each is used (business reason)
- ✅ **Coding Conventions:** Naming, formatting, patterns

**What NOT to Document:**
- ❌ Full dependency list (Claude reads package.json)
- ❌ Implementation details (Claude reads the code)
- ❌ Function signatures (Claude sees them in code)

**Example:**
```markdown
## What Does This App Do?

**TaskFlow** helps remote teams coordinate work with real-time collaboration.

**Core Features:**
1. Real-time document editing (WebSockets)
2. Smart notifications (Twilio SMS, SendGrid email)

## External APIs

### Twilio (SMS)
- **Purpose:** Send urgent task notifications
- **Used By:** Notification system, deadline reminders
```

### Common Workflows

**Starting New Project:**
```bash
cd /path/to/project
cp -r ~/Developer/claude-config-template/.claude .
cp ~/Developer/claude-config-template/templates/CLAUDE.md.template ./CLAUDE.md
# Edit CLAUDE.md to document business purpose
claude
```

**Switching Projects:**
```bash
cd /path/to/different/project
claude
# Claude automatically reads that project's CLAUDE.md
```

**Optimizing Costs:**
```bash
# 1. Start with Sonnet for planning
claude
You: "Plan feature X"

# 2. Switch to Haiku for implementation
/model haiku
You: "Implement the plan"

# 3. Back to Sonnet if stuck
/model sonnet
```

**Creating Git Commit:**
```bash
# Ask Claude to create commit (it follows conventions)
You: "Create a commit for these changes"
Claude: [Analyzes changes, creates semantic commit message]
```

## ⚡ Why This Matters

### Without This Template
- 😰 Spend hours figuring out Claude Code setup
- 💸 Waste tokens re-reading files every session
- 🤷 No clear learning path (what do I read first?)
- 📚 Knowledge overload (too many features!)
- 🔄 Re-explain project context every session

### With This Template
- ✅ Clear path: Follow your persona's checklist
- ✅ Save 50-90% on token costs (CLAUDE.md + model switching)
- ✅ Set up once, benefit across ALL projects
- ✅ Numbered files (01 → 02 → 03) show exact sequence
- ✅ Claude remembers project context (via CLAUDE.md)

### Success Stories

**Before:** "I spent $50 in tokens having Claude re-read my codebase"
**After:** "CLAUDE.md saves me $40/month - Claude knows the context instantly"

**Before:** "45 minutes to set up each new project"
**After:** "15 minutes with the Quick Setup path"

**Before:** "My team uses Claude inconsistently"
**After:** "Shared template = everyone follows same patterns"
