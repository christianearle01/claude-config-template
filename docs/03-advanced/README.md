# 03 - Advanced

**Power user techniques and complex workflows**

---

## What's in This Section?

Master advanced Claude Code features for autonomous workflows and maximum productivity.

### 🚀 Advanced Workflows

**[Advanced MCP Workflows](04_advanced-mcp-workflows.md)**
- Supabase MCP integration (database operations)
- Playwright MCP (autonomous UI testing)
- Skills orchestrating multiple MCPs
- The "highest tier" workflow pattern
- **Example:** UI testing chain (Skill + Playwright + Sub-agent)

**[Sub-Agent Best Practices](02_subagent-best-practices.md)**
- "Tasks not Roles" principle
- Sub-agent architecture (context, prompts, permissions)
- Examples: code-reviewer, ui-tester, documentation-generator
- ❌ BAD: "frontend-developer" (too broad)
- ✅ GOOD: "react-component-optimizer" (specific task)

**[Conversation Branching](06_conversation-branching.md)**
- Shift+Click branching feature
- When to explore alternatives
- Token impact: prevents context pollution
- Can save 50K+ tokens over project lifetime

**[Vision Optimization](05_vision-optimization.md)**
- When to use images vs. text descriptions
- Token comparison: 500-word description vs. image upload
- Examples: architecture diagrams, error screenshots
- Saves 500-2,000 tokens per visual

## Why These Are Advanced

**These techniques unlock:**
- Autonomous workflows (Skills + MCPs + Sub-agents)
- Multi-tool orchestration (database + browser + code)
- Context management at scale (branching conversations)
- Efficient multimodal usage (vision optimization)

**Quote from power users:**
> "Developers are using Skills that orchestrate workflows of multiple MCP tools stitched together"

## The Three-Layer Architecture

```
Skill (expertise) + MCP (data/tools) + Sub-agent (orchestration)
= Autonomous Workflows
```

**Example: Database Optimization**
- **Skill:** Query optimization expertise
- **MCP:** Supabase (live database access)
- **Sub-agent:** Analysis orchestrator
- **Result:** Autonomous performance tuning

## Prerequisites

**Before diving into advanced topics:**
- ✅ Completed [01-Fundamentals](../01-fundamentals/)
- ✅ Understand Skills paradigm
- ✅ Comfortable with Ctrl+O verification
- ✅ Read [Anti-Patterns](../00-start-here/05_anti-patterns.md)

**Without fundamentals, advanced techniques can create:**
- Over-engineered solutions
- Mystery code from autonomous workflows
- Technical debt from complexity

**With fundamentals, advanced techniques create:**
- Powerful autonomous workflows
- Maintainable complexity
- 5-minute updates (vs. 3-4 hours)
