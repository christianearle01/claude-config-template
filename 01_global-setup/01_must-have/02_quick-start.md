# Quick Start Guide - Claude Code Template

Get up and running with optimized Claude Code configuration in 15 minutes.

## 📋 Setup Progress Checklist

**Track your setup progress:** Check off items as you complete them. Claude can read this checklist to help you pick up where you left off.

### Essential Setup (Required)
- [ ] **Part 1.1:** Claude Code installed and authenticated
- [ ] **Part 1.2:** Permission mode set to "plan"
- [ ] **Part 2.1:** `.claude/` directory structure created
- [ ] **Part 2.2:** `settings.json` configured
- [ ] **Part 2.3:** `CLAUDE.md` customized with project details
- [ ] **Part 2.4:** `.gitignore` updated with Claude Code patterns
- [ ] **Part 3:** Verified setup with `/config` command

### Optional Enhancements (Choose What You Need)
- [ ] **MCP Servers:** Installed (Sequential Thinking, Memory, Filesystem, Fetch)
- [ ] **Security Hooks:** Decision made (install, skip, or defer)
  - [ ] If installed: `detect-prompt-injection.js` copied and configured
- [ ] **Custom Agents:** Prompt Polisher agent installed
- [ ] **Skills:** Created custom commands for your workflow
- [ ] **Documentation:** Copied reference guides to project (optional)

### Team Setup (If Working with Team)
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md** committed to git for team consistency
- [ ] **Team onboarding:** Shared TEAM_ONBOARDING.md with team
- [ ] **Coding standards:** Global standards configured in `~/.claude/`

---

**💡 Tip for Claude:** If user says "continue the setup" or "where did we stop", read this checklist to see what's completed and what remains.

## 🎯 What You'll Achieve

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- ✅ Claude Code configured for 70-90% token savings
- ✅ Project memory system (CLAUDE.md) set up
- ✅ Sonnet→Haiku workflow ready to use
- ✅ Optional: MCP servers, security hooks, custom agents

---

## Why This Matters

**Without this quick start setup:**
- Claude re-reads your entire codebase every session (2,000-10,000+ tokens wasted)
- No cost optimization (using Sonnet for everything = 11× more expensive than necessary)
- Lost context between sessions ("What does this project do again?")
- 30-45 minutes setup time per project using trial-and-error

**With this 15-minute setup:**
- CLAUDE.md provides persistent context (95% reduction in context queries)
- Model switching saves 66.7% on implementation costs (Sonnet → Haiku workflow, per official Anthropic pricing)
- Consistent configuration you can copy to all future projects
- Proven patterns from real-world usage (not trial-and-error)

**Time investment:** 15 minutes per project
**Projected savings:** 70-90% token reduction = $30-60/month per active project

## ⚡ Quick Start: Top 3 Shortcuts

**Learn these first** - they'll save you time and prevent mistakes:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ESSENTIAL KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS (Claude Code 2.0+)         │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Esc Esc (twice)     → Undo last changes (Rewind)       │
│  Ctrl-b              → Run command in background         │
│  Tab                 → Show/hide thinking process        │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  💡 These work in BOTH CLI and VS Code Extension        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why these matter:**
1. **Esc Esc** - Safety net for experiments (undo without git)
2. **Ctrl-b** - Keep working while tests/builds run
3. **Tab** - Learn Claude's reasoning process

**More shortcuts available** in the [Keyboard Shortcuts & Productivity](#keyboard-shortcuts--productivity) section below.

---

## Part 1: First-Time Setup (One Time Only)

### Step 1: Verify Claude Code Installation

```bash
claude --version
# Should show: 2.0.58 or higher
```

**Don't have Claude Code?** Install from: https://claude.com/download

### Step 2: Check Your Authentication

```bash
claude
# Should start without asking for login
# If it asks for login, follow the OAuth flow
```

### Step 3: Configure Permission Mode (Important!)

**Before setting up your workspace, configure Claude Code to show you what it's doing:**

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Set permission mode to "plan" (recommended for setup)
# Press Shift+Tab until you see: ⏸ plan mode on
```

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ **Plan mode** = Claude shows you what it will do BEFORE making changes
- ✅ You can review and approve each step
- ✅ Perfect for learning and understanding the setup process
- ❌ **Avoid "acceptEdits" mode during setup** = Claude makes changes automatically without showing you

**How to toggle modes:**
```
Press Shift+Tab repeatedly to cycle through:
1. 🔓 acceptEdits mode (auto-applies changes) ← AVOID during setup
2. ⏸ plan mode (shows plan first) ← USE THIS
3. ❓ ask mode (asks permission for each tool) ← Alternative option
```

**Tip:** Your template already sets `"defaultMode": "plan"` in settings, so you're protected!

### Step 4: Set Up Context7 (Optional but Recommended)

Context7 provides up-to-date library documentation and eliminates API hallucinations.

```bash
# Add Context7 MCP server
claude mcp add context7 npx -- -y @upstash/context7-mcp

# Get your API key (free tier available)
# Visit: https://context7.com/dashboard

# The key will be added to your project's .claude.json automatically
```

---

## Part 2: Set Up a New Project (Per Project)

> **🎓 Learning Mode Reminder:**
> Before starting setup, make sure you're in **Plan Mode** (⏸) so you can see and understand every change.
> Press **Shift+Tab** to toggle modes. Avoid "acceptEdits mode" during initial setup!

### Step 1: Copy Template Files

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Copy Claude Code configuration
cp -r ~/Developer/claude-config-template/.claude .

# Copy CLAUDE.md template
cp ~/Developer/claude-config-template/templates/CLAUDE.md.template ./CLAUDE.md

# Verify files copied
ls -la .claude/
ls -la CLAUDE.md
```

**What you just copied:**
- `.claude/settings.json` - Optimized Claude Code settings
- `.claude/agents/` - Custom subagents (optional)
- `.claude/commands/` - Custom skills (optional)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project memory template

### Step 2: Customize CLAUDE.md

Open `CLAUDE.md` and fill in your project details:

```bash
# Use your favorite editor
code CLAUDE.md
# or
vim CLAUDE.md
# or
nano CLAUDE.md
```

**Required changes:**
1. Replace `[PROJECT NAME]` with your actual project name
2. Fill in **Tech Stack** section
3. Document **Code Style & Conventions**
4. Add **Common Commands** for your project
5. Update **Project Structure** paths

**Example:**
```markdown
# Project Memory - E-Commerce API

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3.11
- Framework: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL 15
- Cache: Redis
- Queue: Celery

## Common Commands
- Start development: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
- Run tests: `pytest -v`
- Migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
```

### Step 3: Configure Context7 API Key (If Using)

If you set up Context7 in Part 1, add your API key to the project:

```bash
# The Context7 MCP server is already configured in .claude/settings.json
# Just need to add your API key to .claude.json (created automatically)

# When you first run Claude Code, it will prompt for the API key
# Or manually add it to your project's .claude.json:
```

The `.claude.json` file will be created in your project root with the Context7 configuration.

### Step 4: Commit Configuration to Git

```bash
# Add Claude Code configs to version control
git add .claude/ CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "Add Claude Code configuration

- Optimized settings for token efficiency
- Project memory system (CLAUDE.md)
- Context7 MCP integration for documentation
- Custom agents and commands

🤖 Generated with Claude Code"
```

**Important:** Make sure `.claude.json` is in your `.gitignore` (API keys should not be committed).

---

## Part 3: Start Using Claude Code

### Step 1: Launch Claude Code

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

You should see:
- Claude Code loads your project
- Reads CLAUDE.md for context
- Ready to code with optimized settings

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Check Permission Mode**

Before doing anything, verify you're in the right mode:

```bash
# Look at the bottom of your Claude Code window
# You should see one of these indicators:

⏸ plan mode on      ← ✅ GOOD - Shows plans before executing
❓ ask mode on       ← ✅ OK - Asks permission for each action
🔓 acceptEdits mode  ← ⚠️ CAUTION - Auto-applies changes (use for speed, not learning)
```

**If you see "acceptEdits mode":**
- Press **Shift+Tab** to cycle to "plan mode"
- This ensures you see and understand every change
- Perfect for setup and learning

**When to use each mode:**
- **Plan mode** (⏸): Setup, learning, complex tasks
- **Ask mode** (❓): Maximum control, sensitive operations
- **AcceptEdits mode** (🔓): Speed, after you're comfortable

### Step 2: Verify Configuration

```bash
# Inside Claude Code, run:
/doctor

# Should show:
# ✅ Settings loaded
# ✅ CLAUDE.md found
# ✅ Context7 MCP connected (if configured)
```

### Step 3: Test Your Workflow

Try these commands to verify everything works:

**1. Test Context7 (if configured):**
```
You: "How do I use React Server Components? use context7"
Claude: [Fetches latest React docs from Context7]
```

**2. Test Model Switching:**
```
You: "/model haiku"
Claude: [Switches to Haiku - 66.7% cheaper!]

You: "/model sonnet"
Claude: [Back to Sonnet for planning]
```

**3. Check Usage:**
```
You: "/usage"
Claude: [Shows plan limits and usage]
```

**4. Test Plan Mode:**
```
Press: Shift+Tab
Result: Toggles Plan Mode (read-only exploration)
```

---

## Part 4: Optimize Your Workflow

### The Sonnet→Haiku Pattern (70-90% Savings)

**Planning Phase (Use Sonnet):**
```
You: "Plan how to add user authentication with OAuth"

Claude (Sonnet):
- Explores your codebase
- Analyzes existing patterns
- Creates comprehensive plan
- Presents options

Cost: ~10K tokens × $3 = $0.03
```

**Implementation Phase (Switch to Haiku):**
```
You: "/model haiku"
You: "Implement the OAuth plan"

Claude (Haiku):
- Follows the plan
- Writes code efficiently
- Makes targeted changes

Cost: ~50K tokens × $1.25 = $0.0625
vs
Cost with Sonnet: ~50K tokens × $15 = $0.75

SAVINGS: 88%
```

### Using Plan Mode

Press **Shift+Tab** to enable Plan Mode:
- Claude can only read files (no modifications)
- Perfect for exploration and planning
- Prevents accidental changes
- Switch back with **Shift+Tab** when ready to implement

---

## Part 4.5: Checkpointing & Rewind System

> **Available in:** Claude Code v2.0+
> **Interfaces:** CLI and VS Code Extension

### What is Checkpointing?

Claude Code automatically saves your code state before making changes, creating checkpoints that allow you to safely experiment and undo mistakes instantly.

**Think of it as:**
- ⏪ **Undo button for AI changes** - Press `Esc` twice to revert
- 🛡️ **Safety net for experiments** - Try risky refactors without fear
- ⚡ **Instant rollback** - No git commands needed for session-level undo

### How to Use

**Undo Changes (Rewind):**

```bash
# Method 1: Keyboard shortcut (fastest)
Press Esc twice → Reverts to last checkpoint

# Method 2: Command
/rewind → Same effect, uses command interface
```

**When Checkpoints are Automatically Created:**
- ✅ Before each file edit
- ✅ Before running potentially destructive commands
- ✅ Before major refactoring operations
- ✅ When Claude uses the Write or Edit tools

### Checkpoints vs Git Commits

**Important:** Checkpoints are NOT a replacement for git. Here's when to use each:

| Feature | Checkpoints | Git Commits |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Session-level undo | Long-term version control |
| **Scope** | Current Claude session only | Permanent project history |
| **Speed** | Instant (Esc Esc) | Requires commit message |
| **Persistence** | Lost when session ends | Permanent |
| **Best for** | Experiments, quick undo | Milestones, team collaboration |
| **Team sharing** | ❌ Local only | ✅ Push to share |

**⚠️ Best Practice:** Use checkpoints for quick undo during a session, but always commit important changes to git for long-term safety and team collaboration.

### Best Practices

1. **Experiment freely** - Checkpoints make it safe to try new approaches without fear
   - "Try refactoring this function 3 different ways"
   - "What if we used a different architecture?"

2. **Review before accepting** - Use plan mode to preview changes first, then checkpoint auto-saves
   - Press `Shift+Tab` to enter plan mode
   - Review the proposed changes
   - Accept → checkpoint created automatically

3. **Combine with git** - Checkpoints for exploration, git for milestones
   - Checkpoint: Quick undo during experimentation
   - Git commit: When you've achieved something worth saving permanently

4. **Don't rely on checkpoints for team work** - Always commit to git for team visibility
   - Checkpoints = your personal undo buffer
   - Git commits = shared team history

### Example Workflow

**Scenario: Refactoring a complex function**

```bash
# 1. Ask Claude to refactor
You: "Refactor the calculateTotal function to use reduce"

# 2. Claude makes changes automatically
#    ✅ Checkpoint created before changes

# 3. You review the changes and don't like them
#    Press: Esc Esc

#    Result: Changes reverted instantly!

# 4. Try a different approach
You: "Actually, refactor it using a for loop instead"

# 5. This time it looks good!
#    Commit to git for permanent history
git add src/utils/calculator.ts
git commit -m "Refactor calculateTotal to use for loop"
```

### Try It Now: Practice Box

**Safe practice exercise** (won't harm your project):

1. Create a test file: `echo "function test() { return 'original'; }" > test-checkpoint.js`
2. Ask Claude: "Change the return value to 'modified'"
3. Verify the change: `cat test-checkpoint.js`
4. Undo it: Press `Esc` twice
5. Verify the revert: `cat test-checkpoint.js` (should show "original")
6. Clean up: `rm test-checkpoint.js`

**What you learned:**
- ✅ Checkpoints happen automatically
- ✅ `Esc Esc` instantly reverts changes
- ✅ No git commands needed for quick undo

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Esc twice doesn't work**

Possible causes:
1. **Not in a Claude Code session** - Checkpoints only work during active Claude sessions
2. **No changes made yet** - Need at least one tool use to create a checkpoint
3. **Session restarted** - Checkpoints don't persist across sessions

**Fix:** Make a change first (any file edit), then try `Esc Esc` or `/rewind`

**Issue: Want to undo multiple changes**

Unfortunately, checkpoints only save the most recent state. For multi-level undo:
- Use git commits between major changes
- Create manual git checkpoints: `git add . && git commit -m "WIP checkpoint"`

### Knowledge Check

Test your understanding:

- [ ] **Can explain:** What's the difference between checkpoints and git commits?
- [ ] **Can demonstrate:** Press `Esc` twice to undo a change
- [ ] **Can describe:** When are checkpoints automatically created?
- [ ] **Know when to use:** Checkpoints for quick undo, git for permanent history

## Part 4.6: Keyboard Shortcuts & Productivity

> **Available in:** Claude Code v2.0+
> **Interfaces:** CLI and VS Code Extension

Master these shortcuts to work faster and smarter with Claude Code.

### Background Tasks (Ctrl-b)

Run long-running Bash commands without blocking Claude's work.

**How it works:**
```bash
# Instead of:
npm run test  # Blocks Claude until tests finish

# Use:
Ctrl-b npm run test  # Runs in background, Claude keeps working
```

**When to use background tasks:**
- 🧪 **Test suites** - Run tests while implementing new features
- 🏗️ **Build processes** - Start builds while continuing conversation
- 🚀 **Dev servers** - Launch server, keep coding
- 📊 **Log monitoring** - Tail logs without blocking Claude

**Practical examples:**

```bash
# Start dev server in background
Ctrl-b npm run dev

# Continue working immediately
You: "Now let's add the authentication feature"
Claude: [Works on auth while server runs in background]

# Run full test suite in background
Ctrl-b npm test

# Keep implementing while tests run
You: "Add error handling to the login function"
Claude: [Adds error handling, tests still running]
```

**How to check background task status:**
- Background tasks run in separate shell
- Check terminal output in separate window
- Or ask Claude: "What's the status of my background tasks?"

**How to stop a background task:**
- Find the process: `ps aux | grep [process-name]`
- Kill it: `kill [PID]`
- Or use Claude: "Stop the background dev server"

### Toggle Thinking (Tab)

Press `Tab` to show/hide Claude's reasoning process.

**When to show thinking:**
- 📚 **Learning complex concepts** - See how Claude approaches problems
- 🐛 **Debugging issues** - Understand the investigation process
- 🏗️ **Architectural decisions** - See the reasoning behind choices
- 🎓 **First-time users** - Educational value, learn best practices

**When to hide thinking:**
- ⚡ **Speed is priority** - Less visual clutter
- ✅ **Simple tasks** - You already know what Claude will do
- 📝 **Documentation focus** - Cleaner output for copy-paste

**How it works:**
```
Press Tab once  → Show thinking
Press Tab again → Hide thinking

Current state visible at bottom of window
```

### Educational Output Styles

Enable special output modes when learning new concepts or onboarding to complex codebases.

**Two modes available:**

#### 1. Explanatory Mode
Detailed explanations with context for every change.

**Best for:**
- 🆕 **First-Time Learners** - Building foundational understanding of all concepts
- 📚 **Intermediate Learners** - Connecting dots between concepts, filling knowledge gaps
- 🚀 **Advanced Learners** - Understanding complex algorithms or architectural decisions in new domains
- **When:** Any code/pattern you haven't seen before, regardless of skill level

**Example output:**
```
Instead of: "Added error handling"

You get: "Added error handling using try-catch blocks because:
- The API call can fail due to network issues
- We need to show user-friendly messages
- The application should gracefully degrade
- This follows the project's error handling pattern in auth.ts"
```

#### 2. Learning Mode
Step-by-step breakdown with educational notes.

**Best for:**
- 🆕 **First-Time Learners** - Step-by-step guidance through every concept
- 📚 **Intermediate Learners** - Breaking down unfamiliar patterns into digestible steps
- 🚀 **Advanced Learners** - Learning new frameworks, languages, or paradigms
- **When:** You need explicit step-by-step breakdown due to unfamiliarity (not skill)

**Example output:**
```
Instead of: "Refactored to use async/await"

You get: "Let's refactor step by step:

Step 1: Convert .then() to async/await
Why: Async/await is more readable and handles errors better

Step 2: Add try-catch for error handling
Why: Async functions can throw, we need to catch them

Step 3: Update return type
Why: Async functions always return Promises

Learning note: Async/await is syntactic sugar for Promises.
It makes asynchronous code look synchronous and easier to reason about."
```

**How to enable:**
```bash
# Request explanatory mode
You: "Explain this refactoring in detail"

# Request learning mode
You: "Teach me how this works step by step"

# Or just ask for either mode by name
You: "Use explanatory mode for this task"
You: "Use learning mode to help me understand"
```

### When to Use Educational Modes (By Familiarity)

Educational modes benefit you most when you're in the **"learning zone"** - concepts that are new/unfamiliar but learnable. Use this guide:

**🆕 First-Time Learners:**
- **Always in learning zone** for this codebase → Use educational modes consistently
- Start with Learning Mode, graduate to Explanatory as you gain confidence
- Expected usage: 80-90% of interactions

**📚 Intermediate Developers:**
- **Often in learning zone** as you expand skills → Use educational modes frequently
- Toggle modes based on task familiarity (new patterns = educational, familiar patterns = normal)
- Expected usage: 40-60% of interactions
- **Highest ROI group** - you're actively bridging knowledge gaps

**🚀 Advanced Developers:**
- **Sometimes in learning zone** when exploring new domains → Use educational modes selectively
- Enable when: New framework, unfamiliar language, novel architecture pattern
- Disable when: Working in expert territory (use normal mode for speed)
- Expected usage: 10-20% of interactions

**Key Insight:** These modes help with NOVELTY, not skill level. Even experts benefit when learning new technologies.

**When to use each mode:**

| Mode | Best For | Situation/Novelty | Avoid When |
|------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Explanatory** | Complex logic, architectural decisions | 🆕 Completely new concepts<br>📚 Connecting familiar pieces in new ways<br>🚀 Expert in new domain | Simple changes, bulk operations, time pressure |
| **Learning** | Step-by-step breakdowns | 🆕 First exposure to patterns<br>📚 Unfamiliar syntax/paradigms<br>🚀 New language/framework | Familiar tasks, production fixes, routine work |
| **Normal** | Daily development, speed | ✅ Working in expert territory<br>✅ Familiar patterns<br>✅ Time-critical tasks | Learning opportunities, unfamiliar concepts |

**Legend:**
- 🆕 = First-Time Learner (always in learning zone)
- 📚 = Intermediate Developer (often in learning zone)
- 🚀 = Advanced Developer (sometimes in learning zone)
- ✅ = Any skill level when working with familiar concepts

**💡 ROI Insight:**

Intermediate developers get the **highest return on investment** from educational modes because:
1. You're actively expanding your skill set (not learning basics)
2. You can recognize patterns faster than beginners
3. You're building expertise in your focus areas
4. Educational explanations accelerate your "aha moments"

If you're between beginner and expert - educational modes are your superpower! 🚀

### Try It Now: Background Tasks

**Safe practice exercise:**

```bash
# 1. Start a long-running process in background
Ctrl-b sleep 10

# 2. Immediately ask Claude a question (without waiting)
You: "What's the difference between let and const?"

# 3. Notice: Claude answers immediately while sleep runs!

Result: You've successfully used background tasks
```

### Try It Now: Toggle Thinking

**Practice exercise:**

```bash
# 1. Press Tab to show thinking
# 2. Ask: "What's the best way to handle errors in async functions?"
# 3. Observe Claude's thinking process (visible)
# 4. Press Tab again to hide thinking
# 5. Ask same question again
# 6. Notice: Cleaner output without thinking

Result: You control how much detail you see
```

### Advanced Tips

**Combine shortcuts for power workflows:**

```bash
# 1. Show thinking to understand approach
Press Tab (thinking visible)

# 2. Ask complex question
You: "Refactor this module for better testability"

# 3. Review Claude's reasoning

# 4. Start tests in background
Ctrl-b npm test

# 5. Continue with implementation
You: "Now add the unit tests"

# 6. Hide thinking for cleaner output
Press Tab (thinking hidden)

# 7. Check test results later
You: "Did the background tests pass?"
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Ctrl-b doesn't work**

- **In VS Code Extension:** Use the built-in terminal, not Claude's output panel
- **In CLI:** Should work by default
- **Alternative:** Ask Claude to run the command: "Run npm test in the background"

**Issue: Tab doesn't toggle thinking**

- **Check:** You're in an active Claude session
- **Try:** Type `/thinking` command instead
- **Check settings:** Ensure thinking is enabled in `.claude/settings.json`

### Knowledge Check

Test your understanding:

- [ ] **Can use:** Ctrl-b to run a command in background
- [ ] **Can toggle:** Tab to show/hide thinking
- [ ] **Can explain:** When to use Explanatory vs Learning mode
- [ ] **Can demonstrate:** Run tests in background while coding

**All checked?** You've mastered Claude Code productivity shortcuts!

## 🎯 Permission Mode Best Practices

### Understanding the Three Modes

**1. Plan Mode (⏸) - RECOMMENDED for Setup & Learning**
```
What it does: Claude creates a plan and shows it to you BEFORE executing
When to use: Initial setup, learning, complex tasks, team environments
Benefits:
  ✅ See every change before it happens
  ✅ Learn how Claude approaches problems
  ✅ Review and refine plans before execution
  ✅ Perfect for understanding your codebase changes
```

**2. Ask Mode (❓) - Maximum Control**
```
What it does: Claude asks permission for EVERY tool use
When to use: Sensitive operations, production environments
Benefits:
  ✅ Granular control over every action
  ✅ Review each file read/write individually
  ⚠️ Can be slow for repetitive tasks
```

**3. AcceptEdits Mode (🔓) - Speed Mode**
```
What it does: Claude automatically applies changes without showing you first
When to use: ONLY after you're comfortable, repetitive tasks, speed is critical
Cautions:
  ⚠️ Changes happen automatically
  ⚠️ You might miss important modifications
  ❌ NOT recommended during setup or learning
  ❌ NOT recommended for team onboarding
```

### How to Switch Modes

**Method 1: Keyboard Shortcut (Fastest)**
```
Press Shift+Tab repeatedly to cycle through modes
Look at the bottom of Claude Code window for the indicator
```

**Method 2: Settings File (Permanent)**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "plan"  // or "ask" or "acceptEdits"
  }
}
```

### Real-World Examples

**❌ BAD: Using acceptEdits during setup**
```
User: "Set up my new project"
Claude: *Automatically creates 20 files, modifies configs*
User: "Wait, what did you just do?"
Result: No visibility, hard to learn, might need to undo
```

**✅ GOOD: Using plan mode during setup**
```
User: "Set up my new project"
Claude: "I'll create these files: [shows list and contents]"
User: *Reviews plan* "Looks good, proceed"
Claude: *Executes with your approval*
Result: Full visibility, learning opportunity, confident changes
```

**✅ GOOD: Switching to acceptEdits for speed (when ready)**
```
User: "I understand the pattern now, switch to acceptEdits"
User: "Update all 50 test files with this new import"
Claude: *Quickly updates all files*
Result: Fast execution, you already know what will happen
```

## 🚀 Your First Optimized Session

Try this workflow to see the benefits:

```
1. Start Claude Code: claude

2. Give a complex task:
   "Plan a REST API for user management with authentication"

3. Review the plan (Sonnet creates it)

4. Switch to Haiku:
   /model haiku

5. Execute:
   "Implement the plan you created"

6. Verify success:
   /usage  # Check your token usage
```

You should see significant token savings using this pattern!
