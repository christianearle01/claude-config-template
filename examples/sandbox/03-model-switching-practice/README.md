# Sandbox 3: Model Switching Practice

**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Skill Level:** Intermediate (Optimization)
**Goal:** Learn when to use Opus/Sonnet/Haiku

## Scenario

Cost comparison exercise across 3 tasks. Calculate savings from optimal model selection.

## Challenge

**Task 1:** Read 10 files → Which model? (Answer: Haiku - 91% cheaper than Sonnet)
**Task 2:** Implement feature → Which model? (Answer: Sonnet - balanced)
**Task 3:** Design architecture → Which model? (Answer: Opus - complex reasoning)

Calculate total cost difference between all-Sonnet vs optimal switching.

## Validation

```bash
./validation.sh
```
