# Python/Pip Security Configuration for claude-config-template
#
# This configuration provides preventative security measures for pip packages.
# Even though this template currently has zero dependencies, these settings
# future-proof the project against malware if packages are added later.
#
# Last Updated: 2025-12-09
# Based on: Package Security Principles (01_global-setup/nice-to-have/02_package-security-principles.md)

# ===== CRITICAL SECURITY SETTINGS =====

[global]
# Use only official PyPI (prevent typosquatting via alternate indexes)
index-url = https://pypi.org/simple/

# Timeout for network operations (prevent hanging on malicious servers)
timeout = 15

# ===== PACKAGE INTEGRITY =====

[install]
# Prefer binary wheels over source distributions (BLOCKS MOST MALWARE)
# Source distributions run setup.py which can execute arbitrary code
# Wheels are pre-built and safer
only-binary = :all:

# Require hashes for production (uncomment when you have requirements.txt with hashes)
# This ensures package integrity and prevents tampering
# require-hashes = true

# ===== USAGE NOTES =====
#
# To allow source builds for specific packages (e.g., packages without wheels):
# pip install package-name --no-binary package-name
#
# To generate requirements.txt with hashes (recommended for production):
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
# pip-compile --generate-hashes requirements.in
#
# To verify package before installing:
# pip show package-name
#
# To audit installed packages for vulnerabilities:
# pip install pip-audit
# pip-audit
