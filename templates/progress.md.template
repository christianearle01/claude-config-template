# Feature Learning & Adoption Progress

<!--
PURPOSE: This file tracks feature completion across sessions to prevent "LLM amnesia"

The Coder Agent reads this file during bootup ritual (Step 2) to understand:
- What features have been completed
- What was worked on recently
- Session notes and lessons learned
- Current project status

UPDATE FREQUENCY: After completing each feature
-->

**Project:** E-Commerce Platform
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-15T10:00:00Z
**Overall Progress:** 0%

<!--
Last Updated: Update timestamp after ANY change to this file
Overall Progress: (completedFeatures / totalFeatures) × 100
-->

## Progress by Category

<!--
GUIDANCE: Update this section after completing each feature.

Visual indicators:
- ✅ Completed (all features done in category)
- 🟡 In Progress (some features done, some remaining)
- ⭕ Not Started (no features complete yet)

Percentage calculation: (completed features / total features in category) × 100

EXAMPLE:
- **Authentication** (2/5 features, 40%)
  - ✅ feat-001: User Login (Completed 2025-12-12)
  - ✅ feat-002: User Registration (Completed 2025-12-13)
  - 🟡 feat-003: Password Reset (In Progress, Est. 2025-12-20)
  - ⭕ feat-004: Email Verification (Planned)
  - ⭕ feat-005: Two-Factor Auth (Planned)
-->

### ✅ Completed Categories
_(None yet - celebrate when you finish your first category!)_

### 🟡 In Progress
- **Authentication** (0/3 features complete, 0%)
  - ⭕ feat-001: User Login (Planned)
  - ⭕ feat-002: User Registration (Planned)
  - ⭕ feat-003: Real-Time WebSocket Sync (Planned)

### ⭕ Not Started
_(Add categories here as you define them in features.json)_

## Feature Adoption Timeline

<!--
GUIDANCE: Add a row to this table after completing each feature.

What to include:
- Date: When feature was completed
- Feature: feat-XXX ID and name
- Status: Visual indicator (✅ Completed, 🟡 In Progress if partially done)
- Notes: Brief summary (tech used, challenges, time taken)

This timeline helps you:
- See momentum (features completed over time)
- Remember what you built when
- Reference implementation notes for similar features

Sort: Newest first (most recent at top)
-->

| Date | Feature | Status | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| _2025-12-15_ | _feat-001: User Login_ | ✅ _Completed_ | _JWT auth with localStorage, 6 tests passing, 2.5 hours_ |

<!--
EXAMPLE ENTRIES (delete these when you start adding real features):

| 2025-12-15 | feat-001: User Login | ✅ Completed | JWT auth with localStorage, 6 tests passing, 2.5 hours |
| 2025-12-16 | feat-002: User Registration | ✅ Completed | Email validation, password confirmation, 4 tests, 2 hours |
| 2025-12-17 | feat-007: Shopping Cart | ✅ Completed | Redux state management, 5 files, 6 tests, 5 hours |

Notes column ideas:
- Tech/libraries used
- Time taken vs estimated
- Challenges overcome
- Number of tests passing
-->

## Next Learning Milestone

<!--
GUIDANCE: Updated by Coder Agent to help you plan next session.

What to include:
- Current Focus: What feature you're working on now (or next)
- Learning Path: Prerequisites and sequence
- Estimated Completion: When you expect to finish
- Resources: Links relevant to current feature
- After Current: What comes next (keeps momentum)

This helps when you return after days/weeks - you immediately know what's next!
-->

**Current Focus:** feat-001 (User Login)

**Learning Path:** No prerequisites → Start here!

**Estimated Completion:** 2025-12-16 (2-3 hours)

**Resources:**
- [JWT Introduction](https://jwt.io/introduction)
- [localStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

**After Current:**
- feat-002: User Registration (2-3 hours, builds on login patterns)
- feat-003: Real-Time WebSocket Sync (10-12 hours, advanced)

---

## Session Notes

<!--
GUIDANCE: Add an entry after each work session.

What to include:
- What feature(s) you worked on
- How long it took (actual vs estimated)
- What went well
- What was challenging
- Blockers encountered
- Next steps

Why this helps:
- When you return after days/weeks, you'll remember what you were thinking
- Documents decision-making context
- Helps identify patterns (always underestimate testing time?)
- Useful for retrospectives and learning

Format: Free-form, use whatever structure works for you
-->

### 2025-12-15 Session
- **Feature:** feat-001 (User Login)
- **Time:** 2.5 hours (estimated 2-3 hours) ✅ On schedule
- **Completed:** All 4 test criteria passing, 6 tests total
- **Approach:** TDD with 6 iterations (form render → submission → API → errors → persistence → logout)
- **Challenges:** Token refresh pattern took 30 min to figure out (axios interceptors)
- **Next:** Start feat-002 (User Registration) - similar patterns, should be faster

<!--
SESSION NOTES EXAMPLES (delete when you start adding real sessions):

### 2025-12-16 Session
- **Feature:** feat-002 (User Registration)
- **Time:** 2 hours (estimated 2-3 hours) ✅ Faster than expected
- **Completed:** Email validation, password confirmation, all 4 tests
- **Reused:** Login form patterns from feat-001 = faster development
- **Learned:** Email regex is tricky - used well-tested library instead of custom regex
- **Next:** Decide between feat-003 (Password Reset) or feat-007 (Shopping Cart)

### 2025-12-17 Session
- **Feature:** feat-007 (Shopping Cart)
- **Time:** 5 hours (estimated 4-6 hours) ✅ On schedule
- **Completed:** Redux setup, add/remove/update cart, persistence, all 6 tests
- **Challenges:** Redux middleware for localStorage sync was new concept (1 hour research)
- **Learned:** redux-persist library would've saved time - next time check for existing solutions first!
- **Next:** feat-008 (Checkout Page) - depends on cart
-->

## Lessons Learned

<!--
GUIDANCE: Document "aha moments" and mistakes to avoid.

What to include:
- Feature ID (for reference)
- Brief description of lesson
- What you'll do differently next time

This section is GOLD for:
- Avoiding repeat mistakes
- Remembering clever solutions
- Sharing knowledge with team
- Improving estimates and approach

Reference these lessons when planning similar features!
-->

1. **feat-001 (Login):** JWT refresh token flow is tricky. Used axios interceptors for auto-refresh. Document in auth.md for future reference.

2. **feat-002 (Registration):** Don't reinvent email validation regex - use well-tested library (validator.js). Custom regex = edge cases.

<!--
LESSONS LEARNED EXAMPLES (delete when you start adding real lessons):

3. **feat-007 (Shopping Cart):** Check for existing libraries before building complex features. redux-persist would've saved 1 hour vs custom localStorage middleware.

4. **feat-015 (WebSockets):** Conflict resolution is harder than expected. Operational Transform is overkill for cart use case. Used timestamp-based server arbitration instead. Document in architecture.md.

5. **General:** Always underestimate testing time by 25%. If feature estimate is 4 hours, allocate 1 hour for tests.

6. **General:** TDD feels slower initially but saves debugging time. Features with tests written first were completed faster overall.

## Statistics

<!--
GUIDANCE: Auto-calculated from features.json.

DO NOT update manually - Coder Agent calculates these.

Purpose: Quick visibility into project progress.
-->

- **Total Features:** 3
- **Completed:** 0 (0%)
- **In Progress:** 0
- **Remaining:** 3 (100%)

**Categories:**
- **Total Categories:** 1
- **Completed Categories:** 0
- **In Progress Categories:** 1 (Authentication)

**Time Tracking:**
- **Total Estimated:** 14-18 hours
- **Total Actual:** 0 hours
- **Average Accuracy:** N/A (complete more features to calculate)

<!--
Time Tracking Notes:
- Track actual time in session notes
- Compare actual vs estimated to improve future estimates
- Average Accuracy = (sum of actual times) / (sum of estimated times)
- If < 1.0: underestimating; if > 1.0: overestimating
-->

## Known Issues

<!--
GUIDANCE: Document technical debt, bugs, or deferred work.

What to include:
- Issue description
- When discovered
- Why deferred (if applicable)
- Plan to address

This keeps you honest about incomplete work without blocking momentum.
-->

_(None yet - track issues here as they arise)_

<!--
KNOWN ISSUES EXAMPLES:

- 5 failing tests in checkout module (pre-existing, documented 2025-12-17)
  - Will address in separate bug-fix session after completing current category

- feat-003 (Password Reset) marked complete but no tests written (2025-12-14)
  - Tests added retroactively on 2025-12-17, now fully complete

- Cart persistence doesn't work in Safari private mode (localStorage restriction)
  - Low priority - affects < 5% users
  - Workaround: Use sessionStorage as fallback
