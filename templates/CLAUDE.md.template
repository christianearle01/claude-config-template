# Project Memory - [PROJECT NAME]

<!--
ONBOARDING GUIDE:
This file helps Claude Code understand your project without re-reading files every session.

**First-Time Setup (Joining Existing Project):**
1. Read [TEMPLATE_PATH]/ONBOARDING_EXISTING_PROJECT.md for detailed setup guide
2. Ask Claude Code: "Help me document what this application does in CLAUDE.md"
3. Focus on BUSINESS PURPOSE (what problem it solves), not technical implementation
4. Document WHY external APIs are used (business purpose), not just THAT they're used
5. Reference package.json/requirements.txt for tech stack (Claude Code reads it automatically)

**What to Document:**
✅ What problem does this application solve?
✅ Key business features (from user perspective)
✅ Primary user workflows
✅ WHY external APIs are chosen (business purpose)
✅ Project-specific conventions and patterns
❌ DON'T duplicate package.json/requirements.txt dependencies
❌ DON'T document implementation details (Claude reads code)
-->

> **Global Standards**: This project follows the coding standards in `~/.claude/coding-standards.md`
> - 4 spaces indentation (not tabs)
> - Big O notation thinking
> - Algorithmic efficiency (target O(n) or better)
> - Clear naming conventions
> - Edge case handling

## What Does This Application Do?

<!--
IMPORTANT: This is the most valuable section for Claude Code.
Describe WHAT the app does (business value), not HOW it works (technical details).

Ask yourself:
- What problem does this solve for users?
- Who are the target users?
- What are the key features from their perspective?
- What workflows do users follow?
-->

**[PROJECT NAME]** is a [type of application] that helps [target users] to:
- [Primary purpose 1 - from user perspective]
- [Primary purpose 2 - from user perspective]
- [Primary purpose 3 - from user perspective]

**Core Features:**
1. **[Feature 1 Name]** - [Business purpose, NOT technical implementation]
2. **[Feature 2 Name]** - [Business purpose, NOT technical implementation]
3. **[Feature 3 Name]** - [Business purpose, NOT technical implementation]

**Primary User Workflows:**
- [Workflow 1: User does X to achieve Y]
- [Workflow 2: User does A to achieve B]
- [Workflow 3: System automatically does C when D happens]

**Examples:**
<!--
Good: "Real-time collaboration allows multiple users to edit documents simultaneously"
Bad: "Uses WebSockets to sync state across clients"

Good: "Automated email campaigns increase customer review collection by 40%"
Bad: "Cron job runs every 12 hours to send emails via SendGrid API"
-->

## Tech Stack

<!--
NOTE: Claude Code automatically reads package.json / requirements.txt / go.mod / Cargo.toml
      for full dependency lists. DON'T duplicate that information here.

Only document:
- High-level tech choices (language, framework, database)
- WHY you chose each technology
- Key architectural decisions
-->

> **Note:** Claude Code automatically reads `package.json` / `requirements.txt` / `go.mod` for dependencies.
> Only document high-level tech choices and WHY they were chosen.

**Core Technologies:**
- **Language:** [Python 3.11 / JavaScript / TypeScript / Go / etc.] - Why chosen: [Reason]
- **Framework:** [Django 4.2 / Express / Flask / React / etc.] - Why chosen: [Reason]
- **Database:** [PostgreSQL / MongoDB / MySQL / etc.] - Why chosen: [Reason]

**Why These Choices:**
- [Technology 1]: [Business or technical reason for choosing it]
- [Technology 2]: [Business or technical reason for choosing it]

**External Integrations:**
See "External Services & APIs" section below for detailed purposes.

---

## External Services & APIs

<!--
Document WHY each service is used, not just THAT it's used.
This helps Claude Code understand the business context of each integration.

For each service, explain:
- Purpose: What business feature does it enable?
- Used By: Which parts of the codebase depend on it?
- Key Operations: What do we do with this API?
- Configuration: Where are credentials stored?
-->

### [Service Name 1] (e.g., Stripe)
- **Purpose:** [What business feature does this enable?]
- **Used By:** [Which features/modules depend on this?]
- **Key Operations:** [What we do with this API - create orders, send emails, etc.]
- **Configuration:** [Where credentials are stored - .env, config/secrets.yml, etc.]

### [Service Name 2] (e.g., SendGrid)
- **Purpose:** [What business feature does this enable?]
- **Used By:** [Which features/modules depend on this?]
- **Key Operations:** [What we do with this API]
- **Configuration:** [Where credentials are stored]

**Example:**
<!--
### Twilio (SMS Messaging)
- **Purpose:** Send automated review request SMS campaigns to customers
- **Used By:** Review campaign feature, reminder cron job
- **Key Operations:** Send SMS, verify phone numbers, receive delivery webhooks
- **Configuration:** API keys in .env (TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)
-->

## Code Style & Conventions

- **Indentation**: [4 spaces / 2 spaces / tabs] - [enforced by Prettier / ESLint / Black]
- **Naming**: [camelCase / snake_case / PascalCase] - [Functions: verb-noun, Classes: noun]
- **Algorithm Design**: Apply Big O notation thinking, target O(n) or better
- **Data Structures**: Use HashMap/Set for O(1) lookups, avoid nested loops on same dataset
- **Code Quality**: Analyze as veteran software engineer, consider edge cases
- **Line Length**: [80 / 100 / 120 characters]
- **Import Ordering**: [Example order below]

**Import Order Example:**
```
[Language-specific example]
1. Standard library imports
2. Third-party imports
3. Internal project imports
4. Type imports (if applicable)
```

**Documentation:** Self-documenting code, comments only where logic is non-obvious

---

## Testing Requirements

- **Test framework:** [pytest / jest / unittest / go test / etc.]
- **Coverage minimum:** [80% / 90%]
- **Run tests:** `[command]` (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`)
- **Run tests before commits:** [Yes/No]
- **Test file naming:** [test_*.py / *.test.js / *_test.go]
- **Test organization:** [Co-located with source / Separate tests/ directory]

---

## Development Workflow

- **Main branch:** [main / master / develop]
- **Feature branches:** [feature/name / feat/name / other pattern]
- **Commit message style:** [Conventional Commits / custom format]
- **PR requirements:** [Tests pass, coverage maintained, reviewed, etc.]

---

## Important Files & Locations

- **Main entry point:** [path/to/main.file] (e.g., `src/server.ts`, `main.py`, `cmd/main.go`)
- **Configuration:** [path/to/config files]
- **Tests:** [path/to/tests]

## Agent Optimization Notes

<!--
Help Claude Code work more efficiently by:
1. Listing large directories to avoid
2. Referencing existing patterns instead of re-analyzing
3. Noting what's already complete
-->

**Skip These (Don't Read Unless Explicitly Asked):**
- [node_modules/ / vendor/ / venv/ - dependencies]
- [dist/ / build/ / bin/ - build output]
- [coverage/ / .coverage/ - test reports]
- [.git/ - version control]
- [migrations/ - database migrations (unless working on them)]

**Reference Instead of Re-reading:**
- "Follow [ExampleController] pattern for new controllers"
- "See [example_service.ts] for service structure"
- "Use [ExampleModel] as template for new models"
- [Add project-specific reference patterns]

**Architecture Summary (Quick Reference):**
- Pattern: [MVC / Microservices / Monolith / Clean Architecture / Hexagonal / etc.]
- Request flow: [e.g., "Request → Controller → Service → Model → Database"]
- [Any other high-level architectural notes]
